When debugging an issue, it is often useful to inspect what the system was doing
in the time leading up to the problem.

On embedded systems it's also desirable to buffer recent logs in RAM and
periodically flush the logs out to a slower medium (i.e UART, Flash). This way
logging does not impact any real time behavior of the system.

The Memfault SDK offers a simple RAM based logging buffer which can be used to
accomplish both!

### Logs in coredump

Any logs present in the buffer get automatically decoded when a coredump is
uploaded:

### Independently collected logs

Logs can also be uploaded independently, without being part of a coredump. These
logs will appear on the Timeline of a Device. A tabular view of log files is
also available under the Log Files tab:

## Integration Steps

In this guide we will walk through how to save logs using the Memfault
[core log utility](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/log.h#L10)
and how the module can be used to queue up logs to flush out to a slower storage
medium.

### 1. Initialize log storage

First you will need to allocate some space for the RAM backed log storage. Any
size works but at least a couple hundred bytes is recommended so at least a few
logs can be stored at any given time.

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"
// [...]

// static RAM storage where logs will be stored. Storage can be any size
// you want but you will want it to be able to hold at least a couple logs.
static uint8_t s_log_buf_storage[512];

int main(void) {
  // [...]
  memfault_log_boot(s_log_buf_storage, sizeof(s_log_buf_storage));
}
```

### 2. Create or Update Logging Macro

If your project does not have any logging infrastructure yet, you can make use
of the implementation in the SDK directly:

```c
#include "memfault/core/log.h"
#include "memfault/core/platform/debug_log.h"

#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_DEBUG(...) \
  MEMFAULT_SDK_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Debug, __VA_ARGS__)
#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_INFO(...)  \
    MEMFAULT_SDK_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Info, __VA_ARGS__)
#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_WARN(...)  \
    MEMFAULT_SDK_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Warning, __VA_ARGS__)
#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_ERROR(...) \
    MEMFAULT_SDK_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Error, __VA_ARGS__)
```

Otherwise, you can wrap a preexisting implementation with a call to
`MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE()`:

```c
#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_ERROR(...) \
  do { \
    MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Error, __VA_ARGS__); \
    your_platform_log_error(__VA_ARGS__) \
  } while (0)
```

:::caution

By default, only logs greater than the Debug level will be saved but you can
change the level either by calling
[`memfault_log_set_min_save_level()`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/log.h#L45-L48)
or by using the
[`MEMFAULT_RAM_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/src/memfault_log.c#L25-L27)
compile time define.

:::

### 3. [Optional] Flush Logs to Different Mediums

The Memfault logging system can optionally be used as a general purpose location
to store logs you plan to save to flash or flush out over UART.

In the example above this would mean removing the direct calls to
`your_platform_log_error(__VA_ARGS__)` and leaving the call to
`MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE()`:

```c
// [...]
#define YOUR_PLATFORM_LOG_ERROR(...) \
  MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE(kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Error, __VA_ARGS__);
```

Then as part of a RTOS task or bare-metal while loop you need to check if there
are any logs available to flush:

```c
void your_platform_log_flush_to_uart_task(void) {

  // .. code to wait for log read event ..

  // draining logs over a UART
  while (1) {
    sMemfaultLog log = { 0 };
    const bool log_found = memfault_log_read(&log);
    if (!log_found) {
      break;
    }
    // an implementation in your platform that can flush a log over a UART
    your_platform_uart_println(log.level, log, log.msg_len);
  }
}
```

Note that anytime `MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE` is called,
`memfault_log_handle_saved_callback()` is invoked by the memfault log module.
You can use this callback to programmatically schedule log flush events when new
logs have been generated by adding the following:

```c
void memfault_log_handle_saved_callback(void) {
   your_rtos_schedule_log_flush();
}
```

:::note

If the RAM buffer fills, the oldest logs will be overwritten. Any time this
happens when you next call `memfault_log_read()`, a log such as "... 5 messages
dropped ...", will be emitted indicating how many messages were dropped.

:::

### 4. Thread Safety (if applicable)

If you are using an RTOS where tasks do not run to completion, you need to
implement the `memfault_lock` and `memfault_unlock` APIs.

Note that locks are only held while copying data into the backing circular
buffers so the durations the lock is held will always be very short.

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"

static YourPlatformRecursiveMutexType s_memfault_lock;

void memfault_lock(void) {
   your_platform_recursive_mutex_lock(s_memfault_lock);
}

void memfault_unlock(void) {
  your_platform_recursive_mutex_unlock(s_memfault_lock);
}
```

### 5. [Optional] Collect Logs after Events of Interest

By design, logs are not collected and uploaded automatically. To trigger
collection of logs, your code will need to call the
`memfault_log_trigger_collection()` API. This API "freezes" the current contents
of the log buffer, marking those logs as pending upload to Memfault. We
recommend using this API to capture additional information when significant
events or unexpected errors take place in your platform.

Pending logs get uploaded just like any other type of data,
[through the data packetizer](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud).

```c

#include "memfault/components.h"

void your_collect_logs(void) {
    // Prepare all logs that are present in the log buffer for collection:
    memfault_log_trigger_collection();

    // When log collection is triggered, let's upload the data from the
    // packetizer to get the logs to the Memfault cloud:
    your_upload_packetizer_data();
}

```

### 6. [Optional] Collect Logs as Part of Coredump

:::caution

This step assumes you have integrated [coredump collection](/docs/mcu/coredumps)
in your project.

:::

:::tip

If you are already collecting all of your `bss` RAM region in a coredump, logs
will automatically be recovered and displayed in the Memfault UI alongside a
crash and you can skip this step.

:::

If you are only collecting select RAM regions, collection of the regions needed
to decode logs can be automatically collected by adding the following to your
memfault_platform_config.h.

```bash
//! @file memfault_platform_config.h

#define MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_COLLECT_LOG_REGIONS 1
```

You'll also want to double check that you have a sufficient amount of space to
store the region in your coredump storage. This can be achieved by performing
the following check after you have called `memfault_log_boot()`:

```c
#include "memfault/panics/coredump.h"
#include "memfault/panics/platform/coredump.h"

void your_platform_coredump_init(void) {
  sMfltCoredumpStorageInfo storage_info = { 0 };
  memfault_platform_coredump_storage_get_info(&storage_info);
  const size_t size_needed = memfault_coredump_storage_compute_size_required();
  if (size_needed > storage_info.size) {
    MEMFAULT_LOG_ERROR("Coredump storage too small. Got %d B, need %d B",
                       storage_info.size, size_needed);
  }
  MEMFAULT_ASSERT(size_needed <= storage_info.size);
}
```
