## Linker "Duplicate definition" error for `HardFault_Handler` etc.

The Memfault SDK includes definitions for several exception handlers, for
example:

- `HardFault_Handler`
- `MemoryManagement_Handler`

etc.

See
[here](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/24f2c2627c9f20e921e61d1b635cab58f34af3b8/components/panics/src/memfault_fault_handling_arm.c#L399-L427)
for the implementation.

These handlers should replace the existing ones in your project. You can remove
the existing implementations entirely, or you can for mark them with the `weak`
attribute (eg, using the `MEMFAULT_WEAK` compiler-agnostic define) to avoid the
linker error.

## What is `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` / `memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()`?

### `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()`

`memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` tells the Memfault fault handler
which memory regions should be collected as part of a coredump. The Memfault SDK
by default will collect the CPU registers and various fault registers of
interest. `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` provides additional memory
regions, which could be the entire contents of RAM, or selected sections only
(the RAM-backed coredump storage provides a default implementation that collects
a portion of the current stack). Typically, if sufficient storage is available,
including the entire RAM regions in the coredump will provide the most
information on a crash.

### `memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()`

`memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range()` is used to filter out sections of
memory that should not be captured by the Memfault fault handler as part of a
coredump. It's necessary to prevent the core dump writer from attempting to copy
data from inaccessible memory regions, which would cause the core dump to fail.
We highly recommend implementing it; usually it's sufficient to set it up with
the accessible memory regions for that device, for example, a chip with a single
`0x40000` byte RAM section, starting at address `0x20000000`, would have an
implementation like:

```c
size_t memfault_platform_sanitize_address_range(void *start_addr,
                                                size_t desired_size) {
  // these values can be provided by the linker script, or explicitly defined
  const uint32_t RAM_ORIGIN = 0x20000000;
  const uint32_t RAM_LENGTH = 0x40000;

  struct {
    uint32_t start_addr;
    size_t length;
  } s_mcu_mem_regions[] = {
      {
          .start_addr = RAM_ORIGIN,
          .length = RAM_LENGTH,
      },
  };

  for (size_t i = 0; i < MEMFAULT_ARRAY_SIZE(s_mcu_mem_regions); i++) {
    const uint32_t lower_addr = s_mcu_mem_regions[i].start_addr;
    const uint32_t upper_addr = lower_addr + s_mcu_mem_regions[i].length;
    if ((uint32_t)start_addr >= lower_addr &&
        ((uint32_t)start_addr < upper_addr)) {
      return MEMFAULT_MIN(desired_size, upper_addr - (uint32_t)start_addr);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Compilation error `variable tracking requested, but useless unless producing debug info`

The following error may occur when building an application that includes the
Memfault Firmware SDK:

```bash
cc1: error: variable tracking requested, but useless unless producing debug info [-Werror]
```

The Memfault SDK requires building with **debug info** enabled. Note that
enabling debug info does not impact the binary executable in the final program,
but only the metadata (debug info) that enables debugging a program.

To resolve this warning, be sure to enable debug info in the build system. For
`gcc` based builds, the following flag can be used:

```bash
-ggdb3
```

Other IDE's will have a "Debug" checkbox in the C compiler settings that should
be enabled, which translates to the above option when the IDE builds with `gcc`.

## Merging auxiliary symbol files into an ELF

Memfault allows including additional ELFs (i.e. for ROM code or otherwise)
inside the "main" ELF file, by embedding each additional ELF in a section
prefixed with `.mflt_aux_symbols`.

The `objcopy` program from GNU binutils can be used to do this. Note, if you are
using a GCC based cross compiler, the binary is likely to be named after the
target platform, for example `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`.

In the following example, we have got a `main.elf` file containing the
application firmware and 2 ROM ELF files, `rom-a.elf` and `rom-b.elf`. The ROM
ELFs are merged into the main ELF, producing `merged.elf`.

Note that the name of the section needs to start with `.mflt_aux_symbols`. When
adding multiple auxiliary ELFs, make sure to add a unique suffixes or else
`objcopy` will complain.

```bash
objcopy \
  --add-section .mflt_aux_symbols.a=rom-a.elf \
  --add-section .mflt_aux_symbols.b=rom-b.elf \
  main.elf \
  merged.elf
```

If there's only a single ROM elf file, `rom.elf`, this example would apply (note
that the output section, `.mflt_aux_symbols`, doesn't need a suffix here because
there's only 1 section of that name):

```bash
objcopy \
  --add-section .mflt_aux_symbols=rom.elf \
  main.elf \
  merged.elf
```

:::note

The symbols and debug info in the auxiliary ELFs are currently only loaded to
produce the backtrace. They are not yet passed into the "Globals & Statics”
view.

## Recommended Compiler and Linker Flags

For a general list of recommended and not-recommended compiler flags, see this
article:

<https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/best-and-worst-gcc-clang-compiler-flags>

Flags that specifically impact Memfault compatibility are listed in the sections
below.

### Link Time Optimization (LTO) `-flto`

We strongly recommend _against_ using Link Time Optimization (LTO) in the
programs you want to be able to debug. See this
[Interrupt post](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/best-and-worst-gcc-clang-compiler-flags#-flto)
for more info.
