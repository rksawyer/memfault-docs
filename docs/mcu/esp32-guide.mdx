This tutorial will go over integrating the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) into
a system that is using the
[ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf) for an ESP32 chip. It
assumes you already have a working project/toolchain for the ESP32. If you do
not, the
[official getting started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)
is a great resource!

The integration works for all versions of ESP-IDF between 3.x and 5.0.

This integration is tested on the
[ESP32-WROVER-KIT V4.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.1/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-wrover-kit.html),
but applies similarly to any ESP32-based board.

:::note

Currently Memfault supports the following ESP32 part families. If it's not
listed, we might be working on it already! Drop us a note at
[support@memfault.com](mailto:support@memfault.com) and we'll let you know!

:::tip

An example project demonstrating the result of this integration can be found
here, for reference:

https://github.com/memfault/esp32-standalone-example

Memfault also maintains a full demonstration project in the Memfault Firmware
SDK, under
[`examples/esp32`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/dbe84b934757ce8ed78cf7840ff1b701f5657fe9/examples/esp32/README.md)

:::

### Clone Memfault SDK

Using a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) client, clone the `memfault-firmware-sdk`
repository from:

```
https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk.git
```

The Memfault SDK does not need to be located within the `esp` directory, you may
place it anywhere.

### Add Memfault SDK to the ESP-IDF CMake Build System

In your top level `CMakeLists.txt`, you can register the Memfault esp-idf port
as a "component" by simply including `ports/esp_idf/memfault.cmake`:

```c
# CMakeLists.txt (top-level)
# [...]

set(MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK /path/to/memfault-firmware-sdk)
include(${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/esp_idf/memfault.cmake)

include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
project(<YOUR_PROJECT>)
```

### Add Memfault Build ID to the ESP-IDF CMake Build System

It is recommended that you use a build ID to uniquely identify each build. Do
this by including Memfault build ID generation by adding a custom post-build
step to your top level `CMakeLists.txt`.

```c
# CMakeLists.txt (top-level)
# [...]

# Be sure to set this variable appropriately
set(MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK /path/to/memfault-firmware-sdk)
include(${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/esp_idf/memfault.cmake)

include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
project(<YOUR_PROJECT>)

add_custom_command(TARGET ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND
  python ${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/scripts/fw_build_id.py ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf)
```

The `fw_build_id.py` script adds a build ID that changes whenever the binary
changes. You can use this build ID as part of your software version reported by
`memfault_platform_get_device_info()`. See the demo app in
`<PATH_TO_MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK>/examples/esp32/apps/memfault_demo_app` for an
example of how to use the build ID in your code.

:::note

`fw_build_id_py` depends on `pyelftools` so you may need to install it by
running `pip install pyelftools`.

:::

### Add the Memfault Porting Files

There are a few files that you must fill in that Memfault requires. There are
template versions in `<PATH_TO_MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK>/ports/templates/`.
Assuming a typical ESP32 project structure with a root directory and a `main`
project sub-directory it is simplest to copy these files into `main`, e.g.

```bash
cp <PATH_TO_MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK>/ports/templates/* .
```

When you are done, you should have the following directory structure in your
project:

```
project-root/
├── CMakeLists.txt  # Top-level
└── main
    | CMakeLists.txt  # Project-level
    //...
    | # Files where port / glue layer to your platform will be implemented
    ├── memfault_platform_port.c
    |
    | # Configuration Headers
    ├── memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def
    ├── memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
    ├── memfault_platform_log_config.h
    └── memfault_platform_config.h
```

### Add Sources to Build System

Edit the project-level `CMakeLists.txt` file in `main` and add
`memfault_platform_port.c` to the `SRCS` variable and
`${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/include` to the `INCLUDE_DIRS` variable. It
should look something like below. You defined the variable
`MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK` in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file.

```c
# CMakeLists.txt (project-level)
idf_component_register(
  SRCS
  # [Your project souces]
  memfault_platform_port.c

  INCLUDE_DIRS
  # [Other project include directories]
  .
  ${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/include
)
```

:::note

Quotes on filenames and paths without spaces are not required in CMake lists.

:::

### Enable Coredump Collection in sdkconfig

By default, the esp-idf uses the `CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_NONE=y`. You
will need to update `sdkconfig` (either via `idf.py menuconfig` or manually) to
`CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH=y`. The change you will see in the
`sdkconfig` file will look something like:

```diff
diff --git a/sdkconfig b/sdkconfig
index a49446d..83a81a8 100644
--- a/sdkconfig
+++ b/sdkconfig
@@ -274,7 +274,7 @@ CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ=160

 # CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_UART is not set
-CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_NONE=y
+CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH=y
```

### Create a Coredump Flash Partition

You will need to allocate an internal flash partition to store panic data. Edit
your `partitions.csv` file to add a _coredump_ partion. If you do not have a
`partitions.csv` file you can create one from the template below and place it in
your top-level project directory where the `sdkconfig` file is located.
Depending on your chip's Flash size you may need to modify the _storage_
partition size in order to fit the _coredump_ partition. Check the Flash chip
size in `menuconfig`, see `(Top) -> Serial flasher config` and check the "Flash
Size" entry. Be sure to specify a custom partition file in the sdkconfig (see
note below).

```bash
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size,  Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x6000,
phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000,
factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000, 1M,
storage,  data, fat,     ,        1M,
coredump, data, coredump,,        256K,
```

:::note

Be sure to indicate the actual name you chose for the partion file in the
`sdkconfig` file. This can be done easily by running `idf.py menuconfig`,
selecting `(Top) -> Partition Table`, and setting the name of the "Custom
partition CSV file". Optionally, you can edit the sdkconfig file directly
(search for the variables prefixed with `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_`).

### Implement Changes for Your Project to Incorporate Memfault

#### Metrics and Trace Definitions

The [device metrics](/docs/mcu/metrics-api) and
[trace event](/docs/mcu/trace-events) subsystems require configuration files to
be added to your include path (`memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def` &
`memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def`, respectively). Because you copied them
to your `main` directory these files' locations should be known to CMake.

#### `memfault_platform_get_device_info()`

When a panic occurs, information is collected to uniquely identify the device
and version of software running. Update the implementation of the function
`memfault_platform_get_device_info()` in `memfault_platform_port.c` by setting
the fields shown in the returned `sMemfaultDeviceInfo` struct.

```c
// memfault_platform_port.c

// [... other code ...]

// NOTE: This needs to be safe to call from the exception handler so
// if you are reading from data from subsytems which uses locking esp_efuse_*
// you will need to pre-populate the data on bootup.
void memfault_platform_get_device_info(sMemfaultDeviceInfo *info) {
  // platform specific version information
  *info = (sMemfaultDeviceInfo) {
    .device_serial = "ESP32_DEMOSERIAL",
    .software_type = "esp32-main",

    // It is recommended to use the build ID script. Below is safe to
    // call regardless.
    .software_version = memfault_create_unique_version_string("1.0.0"),
    .hardware_version = "esp-wrover-kit",
  };
}
```

#### Initializing Memfault

When working with Memfault Firmware SDK version 0.40.0 and above, you will need
to initialize the SDK from your application. This can be done simply by adding a
call to `memfault_boot` from `main_app`. We recommend doing this as early as
possible in your initialization process, so Memfault components can begin
capturing data. Additionally, you should initialize any dependencies used by
`memfault_platform_get_device_info` as this is called within `memfault_boot`.

Here's a code example:

```c
#include "memfault/esp_port/core.h"

void app_main() {
  // Initialize any components that are dependencies of memfault_platform_get_device_info

  memfault_boot();

  // Remainder of your main task
}
```

When using SDK versions prior to 0.40.0, an additional step is required. You
will need to explicitly set `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_AUTOMATIC_INIT=n` in your project.

#### Configure Memfault Project Key

The project key is set via a Kconfig variable, `MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY`.

In ESP-IDF this can be set in a few different places:

- add a line to `sdkconfig.defaults`:

  ```c
  CONFIG_MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY="your-project-key"
  ```

- set it in `sdkconfig`, either via `idf.py menuconfig` or by directly editing
  the file

- set it into an extra sdkconfig file, for example
  `sdkconfig.memfault_project_key`, and include the file when building:

  ```bash
  $ idf.py build -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.memfault_project_key"
  ```

### Regenerate sdkconfig and recompile

Assuming that your project has already been built before adding Memfault you
will need to rebuild now that the Memfault SDK has been integrated into your
ESP-IDF project.

```bash
$ idf.py clean
$ idf.py menuconfig  # Verify your settings
$ idf.py build
```

### Testing things out

_With UART console_

If you built a project with a UART console the Memfault esp-idf port registers
some extra CLI commands so you can easily try things out! Flash and connect to
the esp32 dev board's UART console.

```bash
$ idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB1 flash monitor
```

:::note

Your serial port specification may differ.

:::

As a first step you can try collecting and sending a coredump with the following
commands:

```
// force a crash
esp32> crash 3
// wait for reboot
// join network
esp32> join <SSID> <PASSWORD>
// Post data
esp32> post_chunks
```

_No UART console_

If you built a project without a UART console you can test a coredump by
inserting an assert that will fail, e.g.

```c
   // [...]
   MEMFAULT_ASSERT(0);
```

### Publish data to the Memfault cloud

With the esp-idf, data can be posted anytime you are connected to the internet
by calling the following code. We recommend running it at a periodic interval.
If there is no new data to send, the call reduces to a no-op. The same logic can
also be invoked via the memfault CLI with the `mflt post_chunks` mentioned
above.

```c
#include "memfault/core/debug_log.h"
#include "memfault/http/http_client.h"

int memfault_post_data(void) {
  sMfltHttpClient *http_client = memfault_http_client_create();
  if (!http_client) {
    MEMFAULT_LOG_ERROR("Failed to create HTTP client");
    return -1;
  }
  const eMfltPostDataStatus rv = memfault_http_client_post_data(http_client);
  if (rv < 0) {
    MEMFAULT_LOG_ERROR("%s error: %d", __func__, rv);
  }
  const uint32_t timeout_ms = 30 * 1000;
  memfault_http_client_wait_until_requests_completed(http_client, timeout_ms);
  memfault_http_client_destroy(http_client);
  return rv;
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Automatic Library Initialization

By default in Memfault Firmware SDK versions 0.40.0 and above, the Memfault
library is not initialized automatically. See the
[previous section](#initializing-memfault) for more info. For SDK versions prior
to 0.40.0, a Kconfig exists but is deprecated and not supported for use.
