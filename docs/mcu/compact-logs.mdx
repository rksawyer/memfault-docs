This tutorial will cover how to enable the compact log feature in the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk). When
Compact logging is enabled, format strings will be replaced with an integer id
at compile time. When the log is captured only the arguments and integer id will
be serialized and sent to the Memfault cloud where the full format string will
be recovered.

This has several key benefits:

- Reduces storage for logs on device
- Reduces required bandwidth to send logs to Memfault cloud
- Reduces CPU overhead for storing logs by offloading printf

## Example

Today, once enabled, compact logs will be used when capturing
[trace events](/docs/mcu/trace-events) with logs.

Let's take a look at a quick example:

```c
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(flash_error, "QSPI Flash Erase Failure: error code: 0x%x", 0x5);
```

With a formatted string we need to encode the string length as well as the
entire string in our binary message taking up 41 bytes

```plaintext
00000000: 5153 5049 2046 6c61 7368 2045 7261 7365  QSPI Flash Erase
00000010: 2046 6169 6c75 7265 3a20 6572 726f 7220   Failure: error
00000020: 636f 6465 3a20 3078 35                   code: 0x5
```

where as with a compact log we need to encode a integer id and the arguments to
be serialized which in this example takes a total of 5 bytes

```plaintext
00000000: 8218 8805                                ....
```

So in this example we are able to reduce the storage occupied by 88%!

## Integration Steps

### 1. Enable `MEMFAULT_COMPACT_LOG_ENABLE`

Add the following to your projects `memfault_platform_config.h`:

```c
//! @file memfault_platform_config.h

#define MEMFAULT_COMPACT_LOG_ENABLE 1
```

### 2. Add a log fmt section to your linker script

Locate the linker script for your project (usually ends with `.ld`) and add the
following to your linker script

```linker-script
    log_fmt 0xF0000000 (INFO):
    {
        /*
        Note: binutils >= 0.29 will automatically create this symbol but we set
        it explicitly for compatibility with older versions
        */
        __start_log_fmt = ABSOLUTE(.);
        KEEP(*(*.log_fmt_hdr))
        KEEP(*(log_fmt))
    }
```

## Host Decoding

Compact log data will be decoded by the Memfault app when a log file or coredump
containing log data is uploaded.

Memfault also provides a Python library and command-line utility for decoding
the log data locally (eg, if it's streamed out a UART from the device), which
can be found here:

<https://pypi.org/project/mflt-compact-log/>

See that link for some details on how to use the library.

## FAQ

### How do I fix "## operator not supported" compiler error?

Once enabled, if you see the following compiler error:

```plaintext
memfault/core/compiler_gcc.h:73:45: error: static assertion failed: "## operator not supported, enable gnu extensions on your compiler"
 #  define MEMFAULT_STATIC_ASSERT(cond, msg) _Static_assert(cond, msg)
```

Compact logging uses a
[GNU Compiler extension](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros)
which will remove the leading comma in `, ## __VA_ARGS__` if `__VA_ARGS__` is
empty. This particular extension has been implemented in most other modern
compilers including ARM Compiler 5, Clang & iccarm. All you need to do is make
sure you have enabled gnu extensions for your compiler of choice.

For GCC, this can be accomplished by adding `-std=gnu11` as an argument to your
compiler flag list

### I'm seeing an incorrect pointer value when trying to use the %p formatter.

When the `%p` format is used _and_ the argument is typed as a `char *` or
`char []`, it must be cast to a `void *`. If it is not cast, a string will be
serialized instead and an incorrect pointer value will be displayed in the
Memfault UI.

Here's an example of correct usage:

```c
// No cast necessary for pointer types that are not strings
int i = 0;
uint32_t *int_ptr =  &i;
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG("String Pointer: %p", int_ptr);

// Cast necessary when pointer type is a string
const char *str = "hello world";
MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG("String Pointer: %p", (void *)str);
```

### For ESP-IDF builds, which symbol file should I upload?

For ESP32 builds, Memfault suggests including some additional `POST_BUILD`
commands to strip the `log_fmt` section from the executable. These commands can
be added to the application's top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Remove the 'log_fmt' section from the application after linking. This section
# causes esptool.py to generate an invalid .bin (for flashing + OTA) and needs
# to be removed before the binary is generated.
set(IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE ${PROJECT_NAME}.elf)
add_custom_command(TARGET ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}
  POST_BUILD
  # Save a copy of the ELF that includes the 'log_fmt' section
  BYPRODUCTS ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}.memfault_log_fmt
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE} ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}.memfault_log_fmt
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "*** NOTE: the symbol file to upload to app.memfault.com is ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}.memfault_log_fmt ***"
  # Remove the 'log_fmt' compact log section, which confuses elf2image
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_OBJCOPY} --remove-section log_fmt ${IDF_PROJECT_EXECUTABLE}
)
```

This results in a second `.elf` file, named
`build/memfault-esp32-demo-app.elf.memfault_log_fmt`, which contains the
`log_fmt` section.

This is the Symbol File that should be uploaded to the Memfault platform for
decoding compact logs.

This is the technique used in the `esp32`
[example app](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.34.0/examples/esp32/apps/memfault_demo_app/CMakeLists.txt#L23-L28)
in the Memfault Firmware SDK.

  <summary>👇 See here for details on why this is necessary</summary>

In the case of Compact Logs, including compact log statements will emit a
`log_fmt` section in the `.elf`:

```bash
❯ xtensa-esp32-elf-size -Ax build/memfault-esp32-demo-app.elf | grep -E '(section)|(log_fmt)'
section                                                 size         addr
log_fmt                                                 0xa5   0xf0000000
```

This unfortunately causes the `esptool.py` to output the `log_fmt` section into
the flashable `.bin` that's generated as part of the build:

```bash
❯ ../../esp-idf/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 image_info build/memfault-esp32-demo-app.bin
esptool.py v3.1-dev

```

Flashing that image to an ESP32 board results in a bootloop:

```plaintext
E (419) esp_image: Segment 6 0xf0000000-0xf00000a8 invalid: bad load address range
```

The fundamental problem is that the `esptool.py` tool, which processes the .elf
tool, includes the non-loadable `log_fmt` section in the `.bin` file used for
flashing or OTA.
