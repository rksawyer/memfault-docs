## Introduction

Devices that utilize an MQTT connection may prefer to re-use it to send Memfault
chunk data. This has the following advantages:

- It doesn't require an HTTP client implementation on the device.
- It doesn't require a separate TLS session (possibly concurrent) and
  certificate management, which can reduce memory requirements.

Since the data is not flowing directly from the device to Memfault's
[chunk REST endpoint](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?version=latest#66b0e390-2c3e-4c0d-b6c2-836a287b9e5f)
endpoint, some additional work is required to forward the data from the MQTT
server to Memfault.

Here are some example projects that use MQTT to post Memfault data:

- [Cypress PSoC64 + AWS IoT](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/examples/cypress/CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W)
- [Laird Pinnacle 100 + AWS IoT](/docs/mcu/pinnacle-100-guide)

## Recommended Topic Format

We recommend the following topic format for publishing Memfault chunk data (the
following examples assume this topic is used):

<MqttTopic />

## Publishing Memfault Chunks

An example of publishing Memfault chunks with an MQTT client (here it's based on
the
[ESP32 MQTT client example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/b4d792446c324934fd75e36219254547a54e738c/examples/protocols/mqtt/ssl_mutual_auth/main/app_main.c)):

```c
static char memfault_mqtt_topic[128];

// construct the topic string; can be done once on system initialization
void initialize_mqtt_topic(void) {
  // could be use to control routing for different board types
  const char *board_str = "example";
  const char *device_serial = "DEMOSERIAL";
  const char *memfault_project_key = "<memfault project key>";

  sprintf(memfault_mqtt_topic, "prod/%s/%s/memfault/%s/chunk", board_str,
          device_serial, memfault_project_key);
}

void publish_memfault_data(esp_mqtt_client_handle_t client) {
  // fetch memfault chunk data
  uint8_t chunk_buffer[128]; // size appropriately
  size_t chunk_len = sizeof(chunk_buffer);

  bool data_available = memfault_packetizer_get_chunk(chunk_buffer, &chunk_len);

  if (data_available) {
    // publish the data
    int msg_id = esp_mqtt_client_publish(client, memfault_mqtt_topic,
                                         chunk_buffer, chunk_len, 0, 0);
    assert(msg_id >= 0);
  }
}
```
