Memfault automatically detects what RTOS your system is running. For uploaded
coredumps, it will attempt to extract backtraces for all threads in the system
and optionally determine what state each thread is in and the stack usage high
water mark.

In order for this to work correctly, the coredump must capture the RTOS' thread
state variables, all thread control blocks as well as the stack memory of each
thread. The following sections list for each RTOS what needs to be captured. See
the documentation on [Coredump Collection](/docs/mcu/coredumps) for details on
how to set up additional coredump capturing regions.

### FreeRTOS

#### Required

These variables must be captured in the coredump. On top of this, the memory of
all task control blocks (`TCB_t`) must be captured. Because FreeRTOS TCBs double
as linked list nodes, all TCBs must be captured.

- `uxCurrentNumberOfTasks`
- `pxCurrentTCB`
- `pxReadyTasksLists`
- `xDelayedTaskList1`
- `xDelayedTaskList2`
- `xPendingReadyList`
- `uxTopReadyPriority`
- `xSchedulerRunning`

:::note

There were several releases of FreeRTOS that did not include
`uxTopUsedPriority`, see this GitHub issue:

https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/issues/33#issue-583304006

If the version of FreeRTOS in use doesn't include the fix, add the sample file
(for example,
[this copy](https://github.com/arduino/OpenOCD/blob/c404ff5d3a2ec568daa106455845dd403b08dab4/contrib/rtos-helpers/FreeRTOS-openocd.c))
and relevant linker flags.

:::

#### Optional

- `xTasksWaitingTermination`
- `xSuspendedTaskList`

To enable stack usage high water marking, the `configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW`
configuration option must be enabled and the _full_ stacks for each thread must
be captured as well.

### Zephyr

#### Required

These variables must be captured in the coredump:

- `_kernel`
- `_kernel_openocd_offsets`
- `_kernel_openocd_size_t_size`

### Azure RTOS ThreadX

#### Required

These variables must be captured in the coredump:

- `_tx_thread_current_ptr`
- `_tx_thread_created_ptr`
- `_tx_thread_created_count`
- `_tx_thread_system_state`

### Other RTOSes

Memfault also supports these other RTOSes: Argon, ChibiOS, Mynewt, NuttX,
Quantum Platform, Keil RTX5 / ARM mbedOS, and TI RTOS.
