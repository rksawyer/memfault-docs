## Hardware Version

The Hardware Version is used to identify the type of hardware on which software
is running. In Memfault, a device always has exactly one Hardware Version. It
can be used to identify different device types being tracked in the same Project
(i.e. `smart-toaster` and `smart-oven`) and different board revisions of the
same device type (i.e. `smart-toaster-evt`, `smart-toaster-pvt`, etc.).

:::tip Requirements

Hardware Versions must be between 1 and 128 characters long and can only contain
the following characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `-_.+:`.

:::

:::info

By default, the hardware version of an individual Device gets recorded _once_
(the first time they report in to Memfault). To make this value rewritable,
please contact us at [support@memfault.com](mailto:support@memfault.com).

:::

### MCU

The software running on your devices will need to report its Hardware Version.
Please see the [core/device info component][device-info-header] of the Firmware
SDK for details on how to set this up on the device's software side.

### Android

On Android, Memfault uses the `ro.product.board` system property as the device's
Hardware Version by default. From the
[Android product documentation](https://source.android.com/setup/develop/new-device#build-layers):

> The board/device layer represents \[...\] the bare schematics of a product.
> These include the peripherals on the board and their configuration.

### Linux

On Linux, the Hardware Version needs to be reported to `memfaultd` by the
[`memfault-device-info` program][memfault-device-info], which you need to
implement as part of the integration.

[memfault-device-info]: /docs/linux/reference-memfault-device-info

## Software Type

The Software Type is used to identify the separate pieces of software running on
a given device. This can be images running on different MCUs (i.e `main-mcu-app`
& `bluetooth-mcu`) or different images running on the same MCU (i.e
`main-mcu-bootloader` & `main-mcu-app`). You can also use Software Types to
distinguish between build variants (i.e. `main-mcu-dvt` & `main-mcu-evt`).

Memfault's platform uses the notion of "Primary Software Type" to identify the
main software version for a device.

Each **Hardware Version** has a single matching **Primary Software Type**
associated with it, which is set from the **Software Type** for the first device
reporting in with a particular **Hardware Version**. The association can also be
modified later from the Settings page. An example:

![](/img/docs/platform/primary-software-type.drawio.svg)

The **Primary Software Type** is used to populate the Software Version field on
the individual Device page, as well as when filtering for the device, and how it
appears in various fleet-level charts.

You can configure the **Primary Software Type** in Settings –> Hardware –>
Create Hardware Version.

:::tip Requirements

Software Types must be between 1 and 128 characters long and can only contain
the following characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `-_.+:`.

### MCU

The software running on your devices will need to report its Software Type
correctly such that it matches with what has been configured in the Project.
Please see the [core/device info component][device-info-header] of the Firmware
SDK for details on how to set this up on the device's software side.

### Android

Memfault uses the Software Type `android-build` to identify the system software
running on the device.

Applications have a Software Type equal to their
[application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id),
e.g. `com.acme.smartsink`.

### Linux

On Linux, the Software Type is specified in the [`memfaultd.conf`
file][memfaultd-conf].

## Software Version

A Software Version is a single build of a particular Software Type. Software
Versions are used in Memfault in a variety of ways, including but not limited
to:

- Displaying [Issue distributions](/docs/platform/charts) by version.
- Determining regressions: re-opening an Issue if a defect recurs in a newer
  Software Version after the Issue was marked as resolved.
- Checking if a device is up to date: if your Project uses Memfault to deploy
  firmware, the firmware's Software Version is used to determine if a device
  requires an update.

### Version Schemes

Comparison between versions is a fundamental input to Memfault's OTA system.
Consult the section
[Updating Behavior on our OTA documentation](/docs/platform/ota#updating-behavior)
to see how the rules below are applied to OTA.

#### Ordering

We recommend using a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for your Software Versions,
[see details here](#recommended-versioning-scheme). If you do not use SemVer, we
fallback to using natural sort, as implemented by
[natsort](https://pypi.org/project/natsort/) to resolve ordering.

Memfault uses a slight tweak on top of `natsort` to support `rc` or `dev`
versioning schemes. This is achieved by
[appending a character `z`](https://natsort.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples.html#sorting-more-expressive-versioning-schemes).

For example, these versions are sorted from oldest to newest:

```plaintext
1.0.0rc1
1.0.0
1.0.1-dev
1.0.1-rc2
1.0.1
1.0.12
1.0.20
```

To implement a "release candidate" or "alpha/beta" versioning scheme, the
recommended option is to follow the semver 2.0 specification, for example:

```plaintext
1.0.0-alpha.1
1.0.0-alpha.2
```

Or:

```plaintext
1.0.0-rc.0
1.0.0-rc.1
```

Be cautious about more exotic versioning schemes! `natsort` will only handle the
common scenarios.

For example, the semver 2.0 spec permits appending build metadata to a version
number:

```plaintext
1.0.0+092ced197518c8e304232239315c611af6ff2404
```

But `natsort` will apply lexical ordering (under the default settings), which
may not result in the expected OTA response
([see _"Disable Version Checking"_](#ordering)).

#### Recommended Versioning Scheme

Memfault recommends using [Semver 2.0](https://semver.org/) for versioning.
Specifically, using these forms will result in the least confusion:

1. for official releases, strict semver ("normal version number" per the spec):

   ```plaintext
   1.0.0
   ```

   Exactly 3 digit groups, leading zeros permitted, delimited by periods (see
   the spec for details).

2. "beta" or "release candidate", etc., pre-release versions:

   ```plaintext
   1.0.0-beta.0
   1.0.0-rc.0
   ```

3. automated nightly builds that are deployed over Memfault OTA to a cohort:

   ```bash
   # using a build number (eg CI build number, or monotonically incrementing
   # based on git tag, etc.)
   1.0.0-nightly.0

   # using a calendar version. always increments, and can be generated without
   # context (assuming only 1 build is deployed per day)
   1.0.0-nightly.20220123
   ```

4. development builds generated locally (using git sha or other identifier):

   ```plaintext
   1.2.3+092ced197518c8e304232239315c611af6ff2404
   ```

   And set the _"Disable Version Checking"_ setting for the cohort.

:::info

Note that for these schemes, the `device_info.software_version` field may need
to be populated at build time by the build script. For example, you might have a
C preprocessor token that holds the string for the software version, where the
value is populated by a build script:

```bash
# a C compiler option setting the SOFTWARE_VERSION token to a string
-DSOFTWARE_VERSION=\"1.0.0-nightly-20220123\"`
```

Some potentially useful things to consider:

- if using git tags, see information on `git rev-parse` for generating tag
  strings
- if using a calendar version, the unix `date` command could be used, for
  example `date --utc +%Y%m%d`.

:::

:::tip Requirements

Aside of the requirements that follow from the chosen versioning scheme,
Software Versions must be between 1 and 128 characters long and can only contain
the following characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-_.+:\()[]/` and spaces.

:::

#### Testing

To test version ordering, two approaches are recommended:

1. locally, using the `natsort`
   [command line utility](https://natsort.readthedocs.io/en/master/shell.html):

   ```bash
   ❯ natsort 2022.04.01 2022.10.02 2022.05.05 2022.05.04
   2022.04.01
   2022.05.04
   2022.05.05
   2022.10.02
   ```

   _Note: For exotic versioning schemes, to mimic the way Memfault's system
   operates, it may be necessary to append a `z` to the versions being compared_

2. using Memfault's API, test using a dummy device (assign it to the appropriate
   cohort you are testing):

   ```bash
   # use --get and --data-urlencode to encode the query params correctly
   ❯ curl --silent -i -X GET --get \
     --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY}" \
     'https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest/url' \
     --data-urlencode device_serial=OTA_TEST_DEVICE \
     --data-urlencode hardware_version=${HARDWARE_VERSION} \
     --data-urlencode software_type=${SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
     --data-urlencode current_version=${SOFTWARE_VERSION}
   ```

   See details on the
   [Releases API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#89d8dfa4-10d7-41d3-9c20-7cc356030c4b)
   for more information.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### MCU

A single Software Version is associated with one Symbol Software Artifact
(`.elf` file).

    ├── main-fw     # Software Type
    │   ├── 1.0.0   # Software Version
    │   ├── 1.1.0
    │   ├── 1.1.1
    |   ...
    └── wifi-fw
        ├── 11.0
        ├── 12.0
        ├── 12.1
        ...

The software running on your devices will need to report its Software Version
correctly such that it matches with what has been configured in the Project.
Please see the
[core/device info component](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/platform/device_info.h)
of the Firmware SDK for details on how to set this up on the device's software
side.

#### Android

Memfault supports extracting the Software Version for the `android-build`
Software Type from several different sources in order to suit different build
configurations.

By default, irrespective of the source, the Software Version will be ordered per
[Version Schemes](#version-schemes).

##### Recommended: Build Fingerprint and System Property

We recommend using both the build fingerprint and a custom system property for
situations where the build fingerprint does not contain a meaningful identifier;
for example, if the incremental and ID parts of the fingerprint are set by the
ODM and have no semantic meaning for your internal software versioning.

The full Software Version stored in Memfault will have the form:

```
${fingerprint}::${property}
```

This provides the additional functionality enabled by using the build
fingerprint, while also using a system property of your choice for display and
comparison purposes.

The fingerprint must uniquely identify the build, and the specified system
property must also uniquely identify the build.

##### Recommended: Build Fingerprint Only

Memfault supports using the
[Android build fingerprint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#FINGERPRINT)
as the Software Version. In recent AOSP builds, the build fingerprint can be
found in `out/target/product/$DEVICE/build_fingerprint.txt`.

If the fingerprint is used to specify the Software Version, the fingerprint must
be unique for each build.

We recommend using the fingerprint instead of a single system property because
it enables additional functionality such as the ability to filter traces based
on fingerprint properties like the build type.

Because the build fingerprint is usually a very long string, the Memfault UI
will show only the most relevant part. By default, the "incremental" component
is used for display and ordering; this can be customized to instead use e.g. the
"ID" component.

##### System Property Only

The Software Version can be sourced from any system property. The specified
property must be able to uniquely identify the build (the value must be unique
for each build).

#### Android Applications

For an Android application, Memfault stores both the
[`versionCode` and `versionName`](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning);
the `versionCode` is used to compare Software Versions.

  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/platform/device_info.h

### Linux

On Linux, the Software Version is specified in the [`memfaultd.conf`
file][memfaultd-conf].

## Archiving

Memfault supports archiving Software Types and Versions. This action removes the
selected **Software Type** or **Software Version**. After clicking the Archive
button you'll no longer be able to see the selected Software Type/Version in the
UI. The operation also marks any associated **Events** and **Traces** for
deletion after 30 days.

:::warning

A Software Type/Version cannot be unarchived so proceed with caution!
