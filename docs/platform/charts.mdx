Memfault charts allow you to proactively monitor any smart device, anywhere.
Monitor your releases and view data-driven device and fleet-level metrics, like
battery health, connectivity, and more in real-time dashboards.

## Overview Dashboard

<p>
  The Overview Dashboard offers a selection of charts that provide an outlook of
  the state of your fleet at a glance. To open it, go to{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/overview">Dashboards -> Overview</ProjectMagicLink>.
</p>

Dashboard._

You can filter the data in the Overview Dashboard by Cohort by selecting one in
the drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the page. You can also toggle the
scope of the data between Weekly and Daily on the top-right corner of each
chart.

### Drilldown

Overview Dashboard charts that have a **Drilldown** badge on them can be clicked
on sections of the chart (and sometimes also on labels) to go to a filtered-down
list of Devices that make up the data for that interval.

12th for any reason._

## Metric Charts

Memfault indexes and aggregates the metrics collected by your devices to provide
you not only with insights of how individual devices are performing, but also
the emergent behavior of your entire fleet.

<p>
  You can add charts to visualize these aggregated, fleet-wide metrics by
  navigating to the sidebar and selecting{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/metrics">Dashboards -> Metrics</ProjectMagicLink>.
</p>

Creating a new chart is as simple as clicking `Create Chart`, selecting your
metric of interest, and choosing the desired aggregation type. Note that only
metrics [configured as Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be
used in Metric Charts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/binary-assets/fleet-wide-metrics-create-chart.gif"
    alt="/binary-assets/fleet-wide-metrics-create-chart.gif"
  />
</p>

The list of metrics available in your project is automatically created from the
metrics collected by your devices. For that reason, at least one device must
upload data for a given metric before a chart for that metric can be created.

| Aggregation  | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Min          | The lowest reading received.                   |
| Mean         | Arithmetic mean of all readings.               |
| Max          | The highest reading received.                  |
| Min/Mean/Max | All of the above combined into a single chart. |
| Count        | Number of times a value was received.          |
| Sum          | Sum of all readings.                           |

The aggregation of metric data for each day is performed once the day has ended.
For example, if data is received on January 1st, the metric charts will show
this data on January 2nd. Only values that pass the
["Ingress Filtering" are included](/docs/platform/metrics#ingress-filtering).

For more information about adding metrics to your devices:

- Bare Metal/RTOS: see the [Metrics Guide](https://mflt.io/embedded-metrics)
- Android: update to the 3.0+ version of the
  [Bort SDK](https://mflt.io/android-bort-sdk)

### Issue Charts

Issue Charts show an aggregation of a selection of Issues of your choice and
their occurrence (as a count of Traces of each Issue) over time. They share some
of the features of Metric Charts, including [Comparison Mode](#comparison-mode).

Issue Charts are created from an Issue search. With them, you can represent the
evolution over time of a group of Issues of particular interest to your team.

<p>
  To create an Issue Chart, go to{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/metrics">Dashboards -> Metrics</ProjectMagicLink> and
  click <strong>Create Chart</strong> -> <strong>Create Issue Chart</strong>.
  You will be redirected to the{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/issues?intent=create-issue-chart">
    Issue Search page
  </ProjectMagicLink>
  . Perform a search to filter down the results. Then, click on <strong>
    Create Chart from Search
  </strong>. A modal will appear where the title and optional description for the
  chart can be entered. Click <strong>Create</strong> to save the chart. Finally,
  you will be redirected back to the <ProjectMagicLink path="/metrics">
    Metrics
  </ProjectMagicLink> page, where the new chart will be displayed.
</p>

### Filtering Charts

You can filter the values visible in the charts by selecting from the available
filters on the top-right area of the page:

![](/binary-assets/fleet-wide-metrics-filter.png)

### Comparison Mode

To compare the data from different sets of Devices, you can click the `Compare`
button next to the filters section on the top-right area of the page to add a
new colorized selection to the filters as well as the charts:

![](/binary-assets/fleet-wide-metrics-compare.png)

When comparing Metric and Issue Charts, bear in mind that the aggregations
`Count` and `Sum` lead to absolute values that are a function of the number of
Devices reporting the given value. When visualizing absolute values for
different sets of Devices, the resulting chart could be misleading as the
underlying number of Devices per set may vary.

## Chart Normalization

Chart Normalization converts absolute values such as number of incidents, sums,
and counts to relative values “per 1,000 devices". This helps understanding real
trends when you are comparing these values between populations of different
sizes (e.g. comparing devices from large production cohort Default against those
from a smaller test cohort Beta) or when the population size changes over time
(e.g. new devices being activated continuously or
[changing Fleet Sampling resolutions](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling)).

### Toggling Chart Normalization on/off

![Toggling Chart Normalization at the top](/img/docs/platform/charts-normalized-toggle.gif)

This is a global setting for all browser tabs that you can toggle in the top
right corner of the page, next to the timezone selector. Additionally for
convenience, each chart has a small button <NormalizedCharts /> that allows
toggling the feature globally.

### Charts that support Normalization

![Toggle Chart Normalization at the chart](/img/docs/platform/charts-normalized-per-chart-toggle.gif)

Chart Normalization is supported on all charts that show absolute values such as
number of incidents, sums, or counts. For values that are not affected by the
population size (e.g. minimum, maximum, average) Chart Normalization would have
no affect and the feature is unavailable.

### Population and Normalized Values

The population represents the number of devices that contributed to the value.
Usually, this is based on the **Active Devices** for the corresponding time
span.

![Tooltip for Normalized Charts](/img/docs/platform/charts-normalized-tooltip.png)

Normalized values are depicted with a suffix **1k** in the bottom right corner
next to the value (and are pronounced "per 1,000 devices"). Examples:

- 42₁ₖ means “42 per 1,000 devices”
- 3K₁ₖ means "3,000 per 1,000 devices".

To calculate the normalized value ($Norm$) from the absolute value ($Real$) and
a given population ($Pop$) use the following formula:

$$
Norm=Real\times \frac{1000}{Pop}
$$

For the values in the screenshot above that translates to:

$$
63\textup{M}_{1\textup{k}}=2.2\textup{B} \times \frac{1000}{35\textup{K}}
$$

### Examples of Chart Normalization

#### Comparing Values Between Cohorts

![Using normalized charts when comparing cohorts](/img/docs/platform/charts-normalized-cohort-comparison.png)

Without Chart Normalization (left): Cohort A (blue) reported more than 10x the
duration spent charging compared to cohort B (purple). But in reality, both
cohorts have a growing population with Cohort A consisting of 13,000 devices and
Cohort B of only 1,000 devices.

Relatively speaking, the time spent charging stayed the same at about **60M₁ₖ**.

#### Population Changes

![Using normalized charts for populations with varying size](/img/docs/platform/charts-normalized-growing-population.png)

Two weeks ago, the fleet reported 36K reboots per day steadily growing towards
130K daily reboots. It looks like the devices started to reboot more often. But
in reality, the population grew from 10K devices to 36K devices during the same
time span (as more people unpacked devices).

Relatively speaking, the number of reboots stayed the same at about **3.6₁ₖ**.
