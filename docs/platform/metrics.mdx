import ProjectSettingsMetricsPath from "@site/src/components/ProjectSettingsMetricsPath";

Metrics are a way to proactively monitor any smart device. They power parts of
our Device view such as Device Attributes and the Timeline. You can use them to
monitor your releases and view data-driven device and fleet-level Metrics, like
battery health, connectivity, and more using Memfault's Metrics features:
[Metric Charts](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts) and
[Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts).

Metrics can be marked as Timeseries as well as Attributes, and each option
enables a different set of features in the Memfault app.

## Defining a Metric

Metrics [can be added manually](#from-the-memfault-app) but are also created
automatically when devices report them from the field.

### Automatically from Memfault's SDK

Here are some useful links if you're looking to enable Metrics collection from
your devices using our SDKs:

- for MCU: [Collecting Device Metrics using our MCU SDK](/docs/mcu/metrics-api)
- for Android:
  [Bort SDK Built-In Metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics),
  [Bort Custom Metrics APIs](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics)
- for Linux: [Linux Metrics](/docs/linux/linux-metrics)

### From the Memfault app

You can view all defined Metrics by going to <ProjectSettingsMetricsPath />.

_The Metrics view under Project Settings_

Metric can have a few properties:

- a `string_key` which devices and APIs can use to identify the Metric
- whether the data type is an `INT` (default), `FLOAT`, `BOOL`, or `STRING`
- whether it is a `favorite` Metric, which will cause it to appear more
  prominently in a few places in the web app
- the value `range` which informs charts and other components
- a set of `ignored_values` (like `-1`) which should be ignored.

## Timeseries

By marking a Metric as a Timeseries you'll be able to use it in
[Metric Charts](/docs/platform/charts) and [Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts).
You'll also be able to use them to
[search for devices](#searching-devices-by-attributes-and-timeseries) with a
time constraint (e.g. `battery_level > 90 anytime last week`).

To mark a Metric as a Timeseries, go to <ProjectSettingsMetricsPath /> and click
**Edit** on the Metric you're interested in. Then check the **Timeseries**
checkbox.

## Attributes

You can store custom Attributes for each of your devices to build a device
registry or to manage inventory.

By marking a Metric as an Attribute it will be shown in the Attributes tab on
device pages. You'll also be able to
[search for devices](#searching-devices-by-attributes-and-timeseries) by
Attributes on the device list page.

### Defining an Attribute

In <ProjectSettingsMetricsPath /> you'll be able to mark specific Metrics as
Attributes. Metrics reported by devices are automatically marked as
Attributes[<sup>\*</sup>](#quotas). You can configure this by clicking **Edit**
on a Metric you're interested in, or by creating a new Metric with the Attribute
feature enabled.

#### Device Write Policy

Attributes have a `device_write_policy` property that controls under which
condition a device can change its value. This does not affect the ability to set
a value manually on the device page.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Writable</td>
      <td>
        <ul style={{ margin: 0 }}>
          <li>
            Devices are always allowed to change the value of this Attribute.
            This is the default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Location of a mobile device that changes occasionally.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "120px" }}>If not set</td>
      <td>
        <ul style={{ margin: 0 }}>
          <li>
            Devices can only set the value of this Attribute if it's currently
            unset.
          </li>
          <li>
            Useful to collect static device information the device has access
            to.
          </li>
          <li>Example: MAC addresses.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Never</td>
      <td>
        <ul style={{ margin: 0 }}>
          <li>Devices cannot set the value of this Attribute.</li>
          <li>
            Useful for Attributes that should only be managed manually or
            external systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples: Installation sites, service-level agreement, RMA status.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Viewing an Attribute

There are two ways to view Attributes for a device:

1. using the web application
2. using the REST API.

#### Using the web application

Find the device you want to view the Attributes for (for example by browsing
your devices on the **Devices** page) and select the **Attributes** tab. You'll
see all the properties known for this project and the respective value for the
device you're currently looking at.

![Device detail page and its Attributes tab](/img/docs/platform/device-detail-attributes.png)
_The device detail page and its Attributes tab_

#### Using the REST API

Below is an example of how Attributes can be read using the Project Key and the
REST API:

:::note

Be sure to replace `${MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN}` with an
[Organization Auth Token](/docs/ci/authentication#organization-auth-token) and
`${ORG_SLUG}` / `${PROJECT_SLUG}` / `${DEVICE_SERIAL}` if re-using the example
below.

:::

```bash
curl --user ":${MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN}" --location --request GET \
'https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/organizations/${ORG_SLUG}/projects/${PROJECT_SLUG}/devices/${DEVICE_SERIAL}/attributes'
```

The response will be JSON-encoded data, example below:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "custom_metric": {
        "data_type": "INT",
        "description": "",
        "display_name": "",
        "favorite": false,
        "id": "5e8b5af5-c686-43a7-8ba4-7878f7f9105e",
        "ignored_values": [],
        "range": {
          "max": null,
          "min": null
        },
        "string_key": "TimerTaskCpuUsage",
        "device_write_policy": "writable"
      },
      "state": {
        "created_date": "2021-09-20T13:25:37.517191+00:00",
        "time": "2021-09-20T14:15:17.586209+00:00",
        "updated_date": "2021-09-20T14:15:17.611765+00:00",
        "value": 679
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

You can select individual Metric values by appending a URL query parameter:

```bash
https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/organizations/${ORG_SLUG}/projects/${PROJECT_SLUG}/devices/${DEVICE_SERIAL}/attributes?q=TimerTaskCpuUsage`
```

Only Metrics with matching `string_key` will be returned (wildcard `*`
supported).

### Setting an Attribute

There are three ways to write an Attribute:

1. using the Metrics APIs
   ([MCU](/docs/mcu/metrics-api)/[Android](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics)/[Linux](/docs/linux/linux-metrics))
2. using the REST API
3. using the web application.

:::note

Because devices can update Attributes, anyone who holds your **Project Key** can
write or overwrite these Attributes.

:::

#### Using the REST API

Below is an example of how Attributes can be set using the Project Key and the
REST API:

:::note

Be sure to replace `${DEVICE_SERIAL}` and `${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}` below with the
device you want to update and your
[Project Key](/docs/ci/authentication#project-key), respectively.

:::

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH \
"https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/attributes?device_serial=${DEVICE_SERIAL}" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}" \
--data-raw '
[
  {"string_key": "ProductName", "value": "SmartWatch"},
  {"string_key": "ModelColor", "value": "Blue"}
]
'
```

#### Using the Web Application

Visit the respective device page as described in
[Viewing an Attribute](#viewing-an-attribute). Click on the _pencil icon_ next
to the value, enter the new value, and finally **Save** it.

## Searching Devices by Attributes and Timeseries

You can search devices by Attributes and Timeseries. Visiting the **Devices**
page, open the **Filter** panel.

To filter by Attributes, add a **Custom Attribute** filter.

![Device search by Attribute](/img/docs/platform/device-search-by-attribute.png)
_Searching devices by Attribute_

To filter by Timeseries, add a **Historical Data** filter and select
**Timeseries**.

![Device search by Timeseries](/img/docs/platform/device-search-by-timeseries.png)
_Searching devices by Timeseries_

## Quotas

You're only allowed to use a limited amount of Device Attributes or Timeseries.
If you exceed the quota, you need to turn off the respective aspect for a
different Metric.

To see your quota usage, open your Project's settings page and click on the
Quotas tab.

![Memfault Metric quotas](/img/docs/platform/metric-quotas.png)

Apart from being limited by quotas, the ingestion of Metrics may be
[rate-limited](/docs/platform/rate-limiting#custom-reports). Avoid sending data
more than once per hour per device.

To adjust which metrics count against the quotas, open project settings and
click on the Metrics tab. Clicking on an individual metric opens the edit window
where settings can be adjusted, including how the metric counts against quotas:

![Memfault Metric editing](/img/docs/platform/metric-edit.png)

## Archiving & Unarchiving Metrics

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
If a metric is no longer needed, it can be archived by navigating to <ProjectSettingsMetricsPath />,
clicking on the specific metric, and then clicking the **Archive** button.

To restore a metric, scroll to the bottom of the list of metrics, click on
**Show archived metrics**, and click **Restore** next to the metric you would
like to restore.

## Troubleshooting

### A Metric already exists with the same name

When attempting to create a Metric and one with the same name already exists,
regardless of whether it is active or archived, an error will take place.

Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@memfault.com">support@memfault.com</a> if
you need to re-create the metric with exactly the same name (often in the case
of changing the Metric type).
