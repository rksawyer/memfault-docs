This guide covers Memfault's Single Sign-On (or SSO) offering. SSO allows users
of your organization to log in using your organization's third-party identity
provider. Memfault supports Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth, and SAML-based
identity providers (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Microsoft AD).

:::note

Please [contact us] if you want to use a SAML-based identity provider.

## Enabling SSO

1. As an administrator, visit [**Admin > SSO**][sso-new] to **Add Connection**.
2. Select the identity provider you want to use:
   - **Google OAuth** and **Microsoft OAuth**: Provide email domain that you use
     (e.g. `example.com` for `alice@example.com`).
   - **SAML**: You'll be taken to a guided portal to configure SAML.
3. After the previous step you should end up at again [**Admin > SSO**][sso] and
   the new connection should be visible now.
   - If not, press **Refresh** in the top right corner.
4. Consider turning on the [**Auto-Invite**](#auto-invite) setting.
5. Copy the **Organization Log-In Portal** link at the bottom of [**Admin >
   SSO**][sso]. Bookmark it and share it with your team.

## SSO Settings

### Auto-Invite

When this setting is enabled, any user that signs in through the configured
identity provider will be granted access to your organization. This way you
don't need to manually invite users.

If you turn this setting on after a user has already attempted to log into
Memfault, they might have to log out and log in again for the auto-invite to
work.

### Require SSO

When this setting is enabled, users will not be able to access any of your
organization's resources, unless they have used one of your configured identity
providers.

This also means that [User API keys](/docs/ci/authentication#user-api-key) will
stop working, as they can't be re-authenticated interactively. In that case,
your users will need to use
[Organization Auth Tokens](/docs/ci/authentication#organization-auth-token)
instead. Administrators can and have to revoke them as needed.

Please [contact us] if you want to change that setting.

## Logging in with SSO

Always use the **Organization Log-In Portal** link (found at [**Admin >
SSO**][sso]) for the best experience. It has this structure:

<pre>
  https://app.memfault.com/login/portal/<strong>ORGANIZATION_SLUG</strong>
</pre>

When you visit your organization's log-in portal, you'll be redirected to the
configured identity provider. If multiple identity providers were configured,
you'll be asked which one to use. Once successfully authenticated, you'll be
redirected back to Memfault.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary><a id="organization-slug"></a>What is the Organization Slug?</summary>
  <div>

Each organization has a unique identifier named "[slug]". You'll find it in most
of your project's pages in the URL behind `organizations/` and `/projects`. In
the following URL it would be `acme`:

<pre>
  https://app.memfault.com/organizations/<strong>acme</strong>
  /projects/gadget/issues
</pre>

The login page needs this "slug" to redirect you to the correct identity
provider. We strongly recommend saving a bookmark to your **Organization Log-In
Portal** URL (which can be found on [**Admin > SSO**][sso]) so that you don't
have to remember this piece of information.
