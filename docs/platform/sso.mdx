This guide covers Memfault's Single Sign-On (or SSO) offering. SSO allows users
of your organization to log in using your organization's third-party
authentication provider.

:::note
SSO on can be set up for organization on a per-request basis. We currently
don't support automatic or autonomous provisioning of SSO for organizations.
[Let us know](mailto:hello@memfault.com) if you'd like us to set you up.
:::

Supported providers include:

- Okta
- Google
- Azure AD
- Microsoft AD FS
- OneLogin
- VMware Workspace ONE

Memfault additionally supports logging in with SAML.

## Getting Started

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com) to enable Single Sign On for your organization.

## Invite New Users

Members with an `@your-domain.com` email address will need an invitation to
your organization. Without one, they will be able to log in but they won't be
members of your organization, and will not have access to your organization's
projects.

<InviteNewUsers />

External users will still be able to log in to Memfault with their email address (even if it's not in `@your-domain.com`). If you'd like to restrict access to members with a `@your-domain.com` email address, [please contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com).

## Authenticating With SSO

### Logging Into the App

We have different methods depending on your authentication provider.

</p>

#### Google

To log in with Google, simply click on the **Log in with Google** button. Make
sure you choose the account belonging to your organization, and you'll be
redirected back to the app automatically.

#### Other Providers & SAML

To log in with other providers and SAML, click on the **Log in with SAML SSO**
link, and you'll be prompted to enter your email address. Make sure to enter
the email address provided by your organization.

</p>

After successfully authenticating, you'll be redirected back to the app
automatically.

### Using an API Key

Find out more about API Keys [here](api-keys).

Organization-scoped and Project API Keys will continue to work as usual if your organization has SSO enabled.

However, [User API keys](api-keys#user-api-keys) are going to be rejected for SSO-enabled organizations if you haven't used that organization's SSO provider in more than two weeks. Note that the key will continue to work for a User's own resources or when accessing other organizations they have access to. To reenable access to an SSO-enabled organization's resources with your User API key, log in to that organization [using the application](#logging-into-the-app), with the SSO provider of the organization.
