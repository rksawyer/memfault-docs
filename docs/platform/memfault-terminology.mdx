| Owner Ref                | A user-defined unique identifier which can refer to the "owner" of a Device. Since Memfault wants all your customers data to stay in your own systems, you can use this field to associate a device to a "user" without giving us the user data.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Project                  | A logical warehouse of all the Memfault data related to a particular class of device. Contains Releases, Cohorts, Issues, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Project Key              | The key that is included in the Header of the HTTP request when sending (or retrieving) data from Memfault servers. This is only allowed/required on certain endpoints. It does not grant access to all API endpoints. For general Auth, refer to the Auth section of the Memfault API Documentation                                                                                                                                   |
| Release                  | A logical grouping of Artifacts that are usually built from the same revision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Revision                 | The VCS version that is associated with the Release. If using Git, this would be the SHA-1 of the commit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rollout - Normal         | Make a Release available to all Devices in the Cohort immediately                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Rollout - Staged Release | Make a Release available to Devices in the Cohort incrementally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Signature                | A unique identifier generated for each Trace and used for grouping into Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Software Type            | A Software Type is a specific software package that runs on a Device in a multi-component architecture. Example: If a toaster has two MCU's, one which is the main system MCU and the other handles Wi-Fi connections, then there would be two Software Types, one likely called main-fw and the other called wifi-fw. A Software Type has many Software Versions as updates are pushed to the Device.                                 |
| Symbols                  | The .elf file that is used by Memfault to symbolicate any crash data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Trace                    | A crash or snapshot of the device at a particular moment in time, which can later be converted to a backtrace by Memfault. A Trace can be one of three types: - Trace Event - captures only the program counter (instruction pointer) and the link register (return address) if available - Stack Trace - captures the memory regions of the stack - Coredump Trace - captures most, if not all, relevant memory regions of the system |
| Software Version         | A Software Version is a single release for a particular Software Type. A single Software Version is associated with one Symbol Software Artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
