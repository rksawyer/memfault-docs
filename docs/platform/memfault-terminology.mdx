| Software Type                                  | A Software Type is a specific software package that runs on a Device in a multi-component architecture. Example: If a toaster has two MCU's, one which is the main system MCU and the other handles Wi-Fi connections, then there would be two Software Types, one likely called main-fw and the other called wifi-fw. A Software Type has many Software Versions as updates are pushed to the Device.                                 |
| Software Version                               | A Software Version is a single release for a particular Software Type. A single Software Version is associated with one Symbol Software Artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Symbols                                        | The .elf file that is used by Memfault to symbolicate any crash data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Trace <a id="trace"></a>                       | A crash or snapshot of the device at a particular moment in time, which can later be converted to a backtrace by Memfault. A Trace can be one of three types: - Trace Event - captures only the program counter (instruction pointer) and the link register (return address) if available - Stack Trace - captures the memory regions of the stack - Coredump Trace - captures most, if not all, relevant memory regions of the system |
