# Over-the-Air Updates (OTA)

Memfault provides secure and scalable updates for all IoT devices
([MCU][docs-mcu], [Android][docs-android], [Linux][docs-linux], or a combination
of them). With [real-time monitoring](/docs/platform/charts) and controlled
releases, you can debug and ship new releases confidently.

<OtaCdnFeaturesAdmonition />

## Introduction and Concepts

To deliver OTA Updates:

- Memfault users have different ways to configure which OTA payloads to
  distribute to which devices.
- Each device polls Memfault's [Device OTA Endpoint](#device-ota-endpoint).
- Memfault uses [various inputs](#updating-behavior), predominantly the current
  Software Version of the device, to decide what to return.
- Each device may receive information about a new available payload.
- Ultimately, this process is meant to replace or update the software running on
  a device.

Read about related Memfault-specific terminology that you may need to refer to
to better grasp the contents of this document:

- [Software Versions and Hardware Versions](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version).
- [Version Schemes](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version#version-schemes)
  to understand Software Version ordering.
- Generic
  [Memfault terminology documentation](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology).

## Release Types

Memfault provides two Release entities to solve the challenges of over-the-air
updates: Full Releases and Delta Releases.

### Full Releases

Full Releases provide a way to upgrade device Software Versions regardless of
the version the device is currently on.

If we define the version of the most current Release as `2.0` and every version
lower than `2.0` as `*`, we can describe the behavior of a Full Release as:
`[*→2.0]`.

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details.

#### Must-pass-through Full Releases

Full Releases can be marked as _must-pass-through_, or MPT for short. When an
MPT Release is activated, a device on a lower version will be forced to "pass
through" this Release before an update is allowed to a Full Release with a
version greater than that of the MPT Release. Typically this setting is not
needed.

### Delta Releases

A Delta Release describes a transition from exactly one From Version to exactly
one To Version. The behavior can be described as: `[1.0→2.0]`.

Note that Delta Releases are referred to as ["incremental updates" in Android
documentation][incremental], or "differential updates" in other places.

[incremental]:
  https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/tools#incremental-updates

A Delta Release is only applied when the device’s current version matches the
Release’s From Version.

Delta Releases allow for more fine-grained control over the update paths of
devices. Additionally, Delta Releases generally contain smaller payloads,
reducing required bandwidth and costs associated with rolling out updates.

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details on
Delta Releases.

Another good place to learn more about delta updates for MCU-based devices in
our Interrupt blog post
[Saving bandwidth with delta firmware updates](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/ota-delta-updates).

## Activating a Release

You can activate a Release for a Cohort of your choice. While Releases are
shared between all Cohorts, activating them happens on a per-Cohort basis.

When activating a Release for a Cohort, you can choose between two behaviors:

### Normal Activation of a Release

Releases activated _normally_ are available immediately to all devices in a
Cohort.

### Staged Rollout of a Release

Staged-rollout Release Activations can be used to make a Release available to a
Cohort incrementally.

When a staged-rollout Release Activation is created for a Cohort, a random
subset of its devices (amounting to the selected rollout percentage) will be
marked as _staged_ in this Cohort. Staged-rollout release activations are only
applicable to devices that are _staged_ in the Cohort.

### Best Practices When Activating Releases

Memfault enables risk mitigation through different mechanisms.

#### Monitoring the Effects of Releases

As part of your OTA management workflow, make sure to set up
[Metric and Issue Charts](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts) to monitor the
health of your fleet. You can use
[Comparison Mode](/docs/platform/charts#comparison-mode) to see how devices in a
different Cohort or in a newer Software Version are doing relative to other
devices.

#### Activating Releases in a test Cohort first

Since Releases are shared among all Cohorts, you can use the Release activation
mechanism to test a Release in (for example) a `beta` Cohort before activating
the same Release in a `production` Cohort. Once you've gained confidence through
[monitoring](#monitoring-the-effect-of-releases) that the software in a new
Release is working as expected, you can activate the Release for a bigger
Cohort.

#### Using staged-rollout Releases

Releases activated using a [staged rollout](#staged-rollout-of-a-release) can be
used to limit the amount of devices that will download a specific Release,
reducing the risk of shipping bugs to a greater portion of the fleet. Once
you've gained confidence through
[monitoring](#monitoring-the-effect-of-releases) that the software in a new
staged-rollout Release is working as expected, you can increase its rollout
percentage.

## Updating Behavior

When a device queries the [Device OTA Endpoint](#device-ota-endpoint), the
Memfault platform needs to decide which OTA payload to send it. This section
covers the behavior of our backend when receiving one such query.

In this section, we'll sometimes refer to one Software Version being higher or
lower than another. To understand how Memfault resolves Software Version
ordering, refer to the
[Version Schemes](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version#version-schemes)
documentation section.

:::info

If you wish to better understand Memfault's behavior from the point of view of a
specific device, you can use the
"[Inspect details](#debugging-your-configuration)" feature in the **device
details** view.

:::

### Applicability of an OTA Release

Along with the query to the [Device OTA Endpoint](#device-ota-endpoint), a
device sends:

- the Device ID (often the device serial number) to determine its Cohort,
- the [Software Type][terminology] to determine the set of Releases against
  which to apply these rules,
- its current [Software Version][terminology],
- device-specific attributes such as [Hardware Version][terminology].

[terminology]: /docs/platform/memfault-terminology

A Release must be [active](#activating-a-release) for the Cohort a device is in
to be applicable.

To determine if an active Release is applicable to a device, its payload
attributes are tested against the parameters sent by the device. If they don’t
match, a Release is considered to be incompatible and treated as if it did not
exist.

An Release activated as a [staged-rollout](#staged-rollout-of-a-release) will
only be applicable to the _staged_ portion of the Cohort it targets. In other
words, if the device is not _staged_ in its Cohort, such Releases will not be
applicable.

### Choosing Among Multiple Applicable OTA Releases

If a device has multiple possible update paths, the following rules of
precedence apply to determine which release is selected.

The following rules apply to all active Releases per Cohort:

1. Use a Delta Release whose From Version matches the current version of the
   device.
2. Otherwise, use a must-pass-through (MPT) Release with the lowest Target
   Version that’s greater than the current version of the device.
3. Otherwise, use a Full Release with the highest To Version greater than the
   current version of the device.

In short, the precedence can be summarized like so: **Delta Release** > **MPT
Release** > **Full Release**.

An example:

    alt="ota-example-diagram"
  />
</p>

### Allowing Downgrades

For Delta Releases, downgrades are currently not supported.

For Full Releases, downgrades are disallowed by default. This is to prevent a
device from downgrading to a version that is known to be erroneous. It is
possible to override this on a per-Cohort basis, using the _"Disable Version
Checking"_ Cohort setting:

## Managing OTA Updates with Memfault

The Memfault application contains OTA-related features in several of its views.

### OTA Releases

The **OTA Releases** section of the Memfault application can be accessed from
the main menu on the left side. In it, you’ll be able to access a list view of
all Full Releases and the equivalent list view for Delta Releases by selecting
one of the tabs under the title of the page.

Let's take a look at how to create Releases using the Memfault application.

:::important

Please note that the Release version you choose is expected to match the
Software Version a device will report once it has installed the OTA payload for
this Release.

:::

:::caution

If you're on Android, we recommend following the
[Android-specific OTA guide](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide)
in order to create Releases.

:::

#### Creating a Full Release

To create a Full Release, click on the _Create Release_ button on the top-right
area of the **OTA Releases** view. Among other information, you'll be prompted
for a version and whether the Release is a must-pass-through (MPT) Release.

#### Creating a Delta Release

To create a Delta Release, click on the drop-down icon next to the _Create
Release_ button on the top-right area of the **OTA Releases** view, and select
_Create Delta Release_. Among other information, you'll be prompted for a From
Version and a To Version.

#### Adding an OTA payload to a Release

Once you've created a Release, you'll be redirected to the **Release detail**
view. To add an OTA payload, click on the _Add OTA payload to Release_ button on
the top-right corner of the _OTA payloads_ card.

Alongside the actual payload file, you'll be prompted for different inputs that
a device querying the [Device OTA Endpoint](#device-ota-endpoint) must match for
this Release to be applicable to it.

:::caution

If you're on Android, you'll need to follow the
[Android-specific OTA guide](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide)
to upload an OTA payload, since it can only be done using the
[Memfault CLI](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli/).

:::

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details.

### Cohort Version Management

To dive into your OTA configuration for a specific Cohort, you can access the
**Cohort detail** view by first opening the **Cohorts** list view from the main
menu, and then selecting the Cohort you're interested in.

Under the **Version Management** tab, you'll find the _version matrix_: a live
view into the very next OTA update that each device in this Cohort will receive.

The version matrix consists of rows representing _current versions_ that are
currently reported by devices in the field. Its columns represent _future
versions_ devices of the Cohort will report (after having applied OTA releases).
What follows is a tour of the different interface elements of the version
matrix.

In each cell of the version matrix you'll find a count of devices. If, for
example, a device count of 10K showed up on a cell in the intersection of row
version 1.1 and the column 2.0, that would mean 10K devices are currently on
version 1.1 and the immediate next step they're going to take is to download an
OTA payload for a Release with version 2.0.

Conversely, if 5K devices were to show up on a cell in a row with version 1.0
and under the column for version 1.0, that would mean those 5K devices will stay
on version 1.0.

All device counts on the version matrix are clickable, and will take you to a
complete list of the devices represented under that count.

<figure id="figure-1" style={DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX_FIGURE_STYLES}>

    src="/img/docs/platform/ota/matrix-focus-full-releases.png"
    alt="Figure 1: Full Releases highlighted on the version matrix"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 1: Full Releases highlighted on the version matrix.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

[Figure 1](#figure-1) highlights the area of the version matrix that shows
future versions. In this example, three [Full Releases](#full-releases) exist
(for versions 1.0, 2.0 and 1.1), but only Full Releases 1.0 and 2.0 are active.
This is represented by the blue checkbox icon <CheckSquareTwoTone />. The dotted
line around the icon for the 2.2 version means that there is no Full Release
with the same version.

The <TargetVersionFilled /> icon (which conventionally means "final state") on
top of the 2.2 version shows us that 2.2 is a final target version for this
Cohort. Eventually, all devices in this Cohort will end up on this version 2.2.

<figure id="figure-2" style={DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX_FIGURE_STYLES}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/platform/ota/matrix-focus-delta-releases.png"
    alt="Figure 2: Delta Releases highlighted on the version matrix"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 2: Delta Releases highlighted on the version matrix.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

[Figure 2](#figure-2) highlights the area of the version matrix that represents
[Delta Releases](#delta-releases). The _Current Version_ column is where you may
see the From Version of a Delta Release, and the _Target_ column is where the
Target Version of a Delta Release can be found. An empty drop-down icon
indicates that there is no active Delta Release from the row's version. In the
picture, only a Delta Release (marked with a <CheckSquareTwoTone />) from 2.0 to
2.1 is active .

<figure id="figure-3" style={DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX_FIGURE_STYLES}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/platform/ota/matrix-full-and-delta.png"
    alt="Figure 3: Full Releases and Delta Releases on the version matrix"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 3: Full Releases and Delta Releases on the version matrix.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

[Figure 3](#figure-3) shows the following scenario:

- Two active Full Releases exist (1.0 and 2.0) and there's one active Delta
  Release from 2.0 to 2.1.
- Full Release 1.0 is currently not applicable to any device.
- 21K devices currently on 0.9 are going to download a Full Release to 2.0.
- 36K devices currently on 1.1 are going to download a Full Release to 2.0.
- 132K devices currently on 2.0 are going to download a Delta Release from 2.0
  to 2.1.
- 738K devices are already on 2.1. They will not receive any updates and will
  stay on version 2.1.

<figure id="figure-4" style={DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX_FIGURE_STYLES}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/platform/ota/matrix-staged.png"
    alt="Figure 4: A staged rollout on the version matrix"
  />
  <figcaption>Figure 4: a staged rollout on the version matrix.</figcaption>
</figure>

[Figure 4](#figure-4) shows the addition of a
[staged rollout](#staged-rollout-of-a-release) of a Delta Release from version
2.1 to version 2.2. The percentage icon <StyledPercentageOutlined /> indicates a
staged rollout. In this scenario, only 5.9K devices out of a total of 54K that
are on version 2.1 will download the payload from Delta Release from 2.1 to 2.2.

#### Managing OTA Updates

The version matrix in the Cohort Version Management tab can also be used to
manage your OTA Releases.

<figure id="figure-5" style={DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX_FIGURE_STYLES}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/platform/ota/matrix-actions.png"
    alt="Figure 5: Highlighted actions on the version matrix"
  />
  <figcaption>Figure 5: highlighted actions on the version matrix.</figcaption>
</figure>

[Figure 5](#figure-5) highlights the location of buttons on the version matrix
that allow for fine-grained control of OTA Releases in a specific Cohort.

You can manage Full Releases by using the controls arranged horizontally on the
top side of the version matrix:

- Click on the plus icon on the right end to create a new Full Release.
- Use the highlighted buttons under each future version to create a Full Release
  targeting this version, or to create a Release Activation, abort it, or
  configure it.

Similarly, you can manage Delta Releases using the controls arranged vertically
on the left side of the matrix:

- Click on the plus icon at the bottom to create a new Delta Release.
- Use the buttons next to each current version to create a Delta Release with
  this From Version, or to activate an existing Delta Release.

### Cohorts View

In the **Cohorts** list view, accessible from the main menu on the left side of
the application, some OTA-related information is available for each Cohort:

- Whether a Release is active for the Cohort (under the _ Release Activation_
  column).
- A software distribution widget (under the _Software Distribution_ column).

The distribution of Software Versions in this Cohort is shown in different
sections of the software distribution widget, with the Software Version
representing the ongoing active Release highlighted and placed at the start.

### Debugging Your Configuration

If a device in your fleet is not downloading the OTA payload you anticipated
from our description of [update behavior](#update-behavior), you can use the
**device details view** to find out about the Software Version history of each
particular device, and to inspect the result of it calling the [Latest Release
endpoint][latest-endpoint].

![Inspecting device Software Version history details](/img/docs/platform/ota/device-details-inspect.png)
The _Inspect details_ feature allows you to see the result of calling the Latest
Release endpoint as this device.
