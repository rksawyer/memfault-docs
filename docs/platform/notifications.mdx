## Concept: Sources and Targets

Notifications in Memfault work on a concept of _Sources_ and _Targets_: a
Notification is triggered by a _Source_, and sent to a _Target_. The resulting
output can be sent in the form of an email, or a Slack webhook request.

A **Notification Source** may be:

- an [Alert](./alerts.mdx), defined in terms of Fleet or Device events,
  thresholds and/or conditions to be met
- an [Issue](./issue-management.mdx), representing a group of Traces manifesting
  a particular problem.

And the **Notification Target** may be:

- a _Project Member_ (a user)
- an _External Integration_ (via an email address, or Slack webhook request URL)
- a _Notification Group_ (which is a collection zero or more targets of the
  former two types, routing the Notification to each target in the collection)

Effective use of Notification Targets allows you to direct information to the
concerned parties and avoid flooding your team with non-relevant information.

## Example: Alert Notification Targets

Let's take the example of an [Alert](./alerts.mdx), to understand how Targets
are matched to a Source. First, select Alerts in the sidebar and then click the
"Create Alert" button on the Alerts screen.

In the Alert creation dialog, you see a field labelled _Notification Targets_.
In this field you can select options from the dropdown or type to search the
names or handles of Notification Targets in your project.

</figure>

In the selection pictured above, the Targets `@device-qa-slack` and
`@prod-alerts-pager-duty` represent External targets (recognizable by their
Slack and Email icons), while `@qa-team` is a Group Target (recognizable by the
trailing number in parentheses, showing the number of Targets it contains), and
the Target `@allen` is a single User in your project.

With this selection, the Alert you are configuring here would trigger
Notifications to user Allen Walker and external targets "Slack channel
#device-qa" and "Production Alerts Pager Duty", as well as to whatever Targets
are contained in the "QA Team" Group Target.

## Managing Notification Targets

Under **Settings → Notifications**, there are four panels for viewing and
managing your Notification Targets.

### User Handles

The _User Handles_ panel of the Notifications Settings allows you to view the
list of users in your project. For each of these Users you can see a list of the
Group Targets in which they are included, and you can edit their "handle"
string. This is important for example, in cases where two users' handles may be
the same, or too similar, within the same project.

### Group Targets

Group targets are one of the most important mechanisms for managing
Notifications in your team, allowing you to define the precise lists of Project
Members and/or External Targets concerned about particular events and
information.

### External Targets

External Targets allow you to route Notifications in to external notification
services that your on-call responders may already be using (e.g. PagerDuty,
OpsGenie, etc.) through Email Targets, or to collect them for visibility in
Slack through a webhook integration. These targets can then be included within
Group Targets, to further refine your workflows.

### Default Lists

Default Target lists are a way of pre-setting your target selections, so that
your most commonly used configuration can be pre-filled within newly created
Alerts, speeding up your workflow.

NOTE: The "default default" as it were, is `@everyone` (All Project Members),
but this can be changed to be any combination you want of Project Members,
External Targets and/or Group Targets.
