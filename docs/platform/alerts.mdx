The Alerts feature will send a team an alert when heartbeat events satisfy a
given threshold for a specific set of filters. To find the feature, click the
**Alerts** item in the sidebar.

## Fleet-threshold Alerts

Fleet-threshold Alerts operate on aggregate Metrics conditions. For example, you
could configure a Fleet-threshold Alert that triggers when your `production`
Cohort surpasses a mean count of 5 connection failures in a time window of one
hour.

Only [Metrics marked as Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be
used as a condition for Fleet-threshold Alerts.

## Device-threshold Alerts

Device-threshold Alerts trigger when any Device reports a certain value or range
of values for a Metric.

Let's create an alert when the `battery_perc` (battery percentage) is below 5%,
for devices with serial numbers starting with `MFLT`.

- Click **Alerts** in the sidebar.
- Click **New Alert** in the top right.
- Provide a **Title** and optional **Description** (but highly advised)!
- Choose **Notification targets** to which Alert events will be sent
- Next, the **Condition** value is the Metric string key within a heartbeat.
- We set the condition value to **is less than** **5**.
- We also wanted to make sure that the **Device Serial** values start with
  `MFLT`.
- To do this we click **Add**, and specify these values. To add multiple
  filters, click **add "and" condition** and repeat the process.

- Above, we have created our Alert! Click **OK**

## Results

Once the Alert is set up, Memfault will watch for Events matching the criteria
specified. If it finds any, it will create Incidents, which can be found by
clicking on the Alert entry in the Alerts table.

On top of the entries in this view, Memfault will send an email every **5
minutes** summarizing the number of devices that meet this threshold. Given this
fact, it is best to set up the Alerts so that they are hit rarely to prevent
abuse of the email inbox.

## Notification Frequency

Expect alerts will be delivered in the UI almost immediately under Incidents.
Navigate to
[**Alerts**](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/alerts) and
select the Alert you want. Incidents are listed per device. An email will also
get sent once every 12 hours.

At most 1 incident is generated in a 24 hour period per device. This is to
minimize the number of incidents created and avoid alert fatigue. Devices can
hit a metric threshold multiple times in 24 hours without creating duplicate
incidents.

:::info

When only 1 device hits a metric threshold within the last 24 hours and reports
an alert incident, the captured date timestamp is updated once within 24 hours.
When multiple devices begin hitting the threshold for a given metric within a 24
hour period, the captured date timestamp will be updated when the new alert is
emitted.
