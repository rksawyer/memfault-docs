title: Rate Limiting

import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";

Memfault employs rate limiting to prevent malfunctioning devices from causing
excessive amounts of traffic on the platform, which in turn improves site
stability. Rate limits also help us provide fair pricing to our customers.

Below is a list of the APIs and payloads that may be rate-limited:
