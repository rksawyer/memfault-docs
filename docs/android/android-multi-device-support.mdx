Your product might consist of multiple Android devices connected together, where
not all of the devices have direct internet access - this presents a challenge
uploading diagnostics (and downloading settings) from the un-connected
_companion_ devices.

The Bort SDK (since version 4.0) supports offloading data from the _companion_
devices, if there is a socket connection available to communicate between them.
We call this **client-server mode** and it allows all participating devices to
communicate with Memfault while only the server device is connected to the
Internet.

## Client-Server mode

Disabled by default, Bort's client-server mode allows designating a
network-connected Android device running the Bort SDK as _server_. One or more
connected devices without direct network access can be designated _client_.

Bort running on the _client_ device will collect and forward diagnostic data to
Bort running on the _server_ device via a socket connection, so that the data
can be forwarded to Memfault's web services.

Data is bundled together in a
[MAR archive](/docs/android/uploading-android-diagnostics#uploading-a-mar-file).
This compressed file format collects several types of data (e.g. logs, metrics,
bug reports) together, so that they can be uploaded in one file - resulting in
fewer HTTP requests.

## Supported features

All data collected by Bort (bugreports, logs, metrics, crashes/WTFs/ANRs/etc) is
forwarded from _client_ devices to Memfault's web services when using
**client-server** mode.

Bort running on the _server_ device will forward SDK settings to the _client_
device - this ensures that Bort on both devices is always fully remotely
configurable.

## Enabling Client-Server connectivity

This mode is disabled by default. To enable, there are two configuration steps:

### Configure Client-Server system property on each device

Set a system property (`vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode`) on each of the
devices, describing its role. This might be set in a `product.mk` file specific
to each device e.g.:

```
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode=server
```

or

```
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode=client
```

If this property is absent, or not set to either `server` or `client` then the
client-server feature is disabled.

:::info

This property is configured individually per device. A system property is used
for this reason (so that the Bort SDK does not have to be configured/compiled
separately for each device).

:::

### Configure socket communication parameters

Set the `CLIENT_SERVER_PORT` and `CLIENT_SERVER_HOST` parameters in
`bort.properties`. The _server_ device must be able to listen for connections on
this port, and the _client_ devices must be able to communicate with the
_server_ using this hostname and port.

The Bort `UsageReporter` persistent service on the _server_ device will listen
for connections on this host/port, and on _client_ devices will attempt to
establish a connection with the _server_ device.

:::info

This property is configured as part of the Bort build - this enables the use of
the same Bort/UsageReporter apks on each of the devices (i.e. it is _not_
required to maintain/build separately configured versions of the Bort SDK for
each of the connected Android devices).

:::

### Configure network interfaces

Ensure that device network/firewall configuration is set up so that the
client/server devices can communicate using the hostname/port specified in your
`bort.properties` file.

For security reasons, the network interface that the _server_ device is
listening on should not be publicly accessible - it is expected to be an
interface which can only communicate with the _client_ device.
