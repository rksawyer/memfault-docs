:::info

Custom Events were previously called Structured Logs. This API was changed in
Bort 3.6.0.

Any code using the `StructuredLog` or `CustomEvent` APIs from the
`structured-log-lib` or `custom-event-lib` libraries (now removed) must be
changed to call the equivalent methods in the `CustomEvent` API from the
`reporting-lib` library, as described below.

When diagnosing Android device issues, logcat logs are one of the most common
sources of information to use. Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio can be
poor. On top of that, logcat prunes logs from chatty sources, causing important
logs to get lost.

The Custom Events feature is a complementary mechanism to log events of interest
for debugging purposes. Your application and systems code can leverage this to
log crucial information and get it surfaced in the Memfault UI.

Custom Events appear on the Device Timeline. For each type of log, a dedicated
swimlane is created automatically. Each log is represented with a dot. Clicking
or hovering over it will reveal the logged JSON data:

## Overview

Custom Events are collected by the MemfaultStructuredLogd daemon that is built &
installed automatically as part of the Memfault Bort SDK. The daemon exposes a
Binder service that log producers can use to send Custom Events to the daemon.
For ease of use, the SDK also includes a small, Java library that exposes a
simple API (see [Logging API](#logging-api) below). The MemfaultStructuredLogd
daemon buffers received logs to disk until it is required to flush all pending
logs to the Bort app (MemfaultBort.apk). This flushing happens periodically,
when the buffer has reached a certain size limit or when requested explicitly
(see [Testing & Debugging](#testing--debugging)). Finally, the Bort app is
responsible for batch-uploading the collected logs to the Memfault web service.

:::tip

Each Custom Event has a "type" (string) and contains structured data in the form
of a JSON payload. The schema of the JSON payload is up to you. That said, we
recommend using the same schema for a given type. Future aggregation features
may require this.

:::note Rate Limiting

Ingestion of Custom Events may be
[rate-limited](/docs/platform/rate-limiting#custom-events). Avoid sending more
than 1000 custom events per hour per device.

## Adding Custom Events

Tapping into the Custom Events feature, boils down to these steps:

- Defining the log types and data payloads your applications and services need
  to log
- Add the `reporting-lib` library to the component from which you want to log
- Call the `CustomEvent.log(...)` API
- Test & Debug

### Defining Custom Event types and data payloads

Both the "type" and JSON data payload are free-form in principle. That said, we
recommend the following to get the most out of Custom Events:

- Keep the "schema" of a JSON data payload the same for all logs of a given
  type. Future aggregation features may require this.
- Group different but related types together by prefixing the type string with
  the name of the group. We recommend using a period as separator. For example,
  `"motor.start"` and `"motor.stop"`.
- Each type of log is visualized in a swimlane of its own. Keep this in mind
  when structuring your log types.
- Only log for important events, errors, etc. Logs are visualized on the Device
  Timeline. When logging too much, all the time, the visualization breaks down
  quickly.
- Type strings should be statically defined in your code. Do not create type
  strings dynamically at run-time.

### Add the `reporting-lib` library

The `reporting-lib` library is a small Java library that wraps the Binder
service that is published by MemfaultStructuredLogd. The next two sections
describe how to add this library to an AOSP-built Java app and how to add it to
a Gradle-built Java or Kotlin app.

Note it is possible to log from native C/C++ programs, but we do not have a
C/C++ helper library at the moment.

#### Add `reporting-lib` to AOSP-built Java apps

Make sure the
[Bort SDK has been integrated](https://mflt.io/android-getting-started) with
your AOSP build first.

Once integrated, a target called `memfault-reporting-lib` will be available.
This is a static Java library that will need to be linked to your app's build
target.

If you are using an Android.mk file, add this to the
`LOCAL_STATIC_JAVA_LIBRARIES` variable in your app's Android.mk file:

```makefile
LOCAL_STATIC_JAVA_LIBRARIES := \
    memfault-reporting-lib \
```

Or if you are using an Android.bp file, add `memfault-reporting-lib` to a
`static_libs` clause of your build target:

```
 static_libs: [
    "memfault-reporting-lib"
 ]
```

#### Add `reporting-lib` to Gradle-built, Java or Kotlin apps

For apps that are build outside of the AOSP build system using Gradle, the
easiest way to include the `reporting-lib` published on Maven Central.

Ensure that Maven Central is included in your project's root `build.gradle`
file:

```
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
   ...
}
```

Then in your app's `build.gradle` file, add:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.memfault.bort:reporting-lib:1.0'
    ...
}
```

When you build your project, the `reporting-lib` library will be built as well
and can now be used from your app's Java or Kotlin source files.

### Logging API

```java
import com.memfault.bort.customevent.CustomEvent;

// Create a Custom Event
// with type "door.open" and JSON payload: { "foo": 123, "bar": true }
CustomEvent.log("door.open", "{\"foo\": 123, \"bar\": true}");
```

As you can see from the snippet above, the API is extremely simple. The first
argument is the type of the Custom Event and is a string.

The second argument is the data payload and must be a string containing valid
JSON, of up to 4KB in size.

For the sake of simplicity of this example, we hand-coded the JSON string. In
real projects, we recommend using a JSON serialization library.

In case the data was invalid JSON or exceeded the 4KB limit, "Invalid Data" and
respectively "Oversized Data" swimlanes will appear in the Device Timeline,
containing information to help debug these issues.

### Testing & Debugging

By default, the MemfaultStructuredLogd daemon only flushes out received logs
periodically or when the configured maximum log count has been reached. During
development, this is not very practical. Therefore, on debug builds of AOSP, you
can also programmatically trigger it to flush out received logs:

```java
import com.memfault.bort.customevent.CustomEvent;

// Asks MemfaultStructuredLogd to flush out pending logs:
CustomEvent.dump();
```

Note that the `CustomEvent.dump()` API is only available on debug builds of AOSP
and it is a no-op in user builds.

MemfaultStructuredLogd writes the pending logs to a file and passes it to
Android's DropBoxManager subsystem. The MemfaultBort.apk app then picks it up
from the DropBoxManager and uploads it to Memfault's web service.

During debugging, it can also be useful to inspect the files in Android's
DropBoxManager subsystem directly. You can do this through a root adb shell:

```shell
$ adb root
$ adb shell
# ls /data/system/dropbox/ | grep memfault
memfault_structured@1619774084281.dat
memfault_structured@1619774633397.dat
memfault_structured@1619774689613.dat
memfault_structured@1619775481075.dat
# cat /data/system/dropbox/memfault_structured@1619775481075.dat
... JSON dump of the file ...
```
