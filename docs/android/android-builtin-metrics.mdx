The Bort SDK contains built-in support for collecting various types of metrics
from Android devices.

Some are automatically collected, and some require configuration in the Memfault
dashboard.

To record custom metrics, see the
[Reporting APIs](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics).

:::info

Be sure to configure which metrics you would like to be
[Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) and
[Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes) in the Metrics Dashboard.

### Battery (and related) Metrics

**Collected Since Bort 3.0**

Bort collects metrics from the
[Android batterystats subsystem](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian).
This includes data from many components which may affect battery usage (Radio,
Wifi, Bluetooth, Screen, CPU, GPS), in addition to statistics about the battery
itself.

These metrics are displayed on the device timeline:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-battery-timeline-min.png)

And several summary metrics are also available. Each metric is listed below,
noting the batterystats output code that it is derived from (they are defined in
the
[batterystats source](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/os/BatteryStats.java)):

- `audio_on_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) audio was switched on (see
  batterystats `a`).
- `battery_health_not_good_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) when the battery
  health was not "good" (`g`) (see batterystats `Bh`).
- `battery_level_pct_avg`: mean battery level (0-100).
- `bluetooth_scan_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) with bluetooth LE
  scanning active (see batterystats `bles`).
- `cpu_running_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) CPU was running (see
  batterystats `r`).
- `cpu_resume_count_per_hour`: number of times per hour CPU became active (see
  batterystats `r`).
- `cpu_suspend_count_per_hour`: number of times per hour CPU became inactive
  (see batterystats `r`).
- `cpu_wake_count_per_hour`: number of individual CPU wakeups (see batterystats
  `wr`).
- `doze_full_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) spent in full Doze mode (see
  batterystats `di`).
- `doze_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) spent in any (full or light) Doze
  mode (see batterystats `di`).
- `gps_on_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) GPS was switched on (see
  batterystats `g`).
- `max_battery_temp`: maximum battery temperature (°C x 10) during the period
  (see batterystats `Bt`).
- `phone_radio_active_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the phone radio was
  active (see batterystats `Pr`).
- `phone_scanning_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the phone was scanning
  (see batterystats `Psc`).
- `phone_signal_strength_none_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the phone
  signal strength was "none" (`0`) (see batterystats `Pss`).
- `phone_signal_strength_poor_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the phone
  signal strength was "poor" (`1`) (see batterystats `Pss`).
- `screen_on_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the screen was on (see
  batterystats `S`).
- `screen_brightness_light_or_bright_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) the
  screen brightness was "light" (`3`) or "bright" (`4`) (see batterystats `Sb`).
- `wifi_on_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) Wifi was on (see batterystats
  `W`).
- `wifi_radio_active_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) Wifi was on (see
  batterystats `Wr`).
- `wifi_running_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) Wifi was on (see
  batterystats `Ww`).
- `wifi_scan_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0) Wifi was scanning (see
  batterystats `Ws`).
- `wifi_signal_strength_poor_or_very_poor_ratio`: percentage of time (0.0-1.0)
  Wifi signal was "poor" (`1`) or "very poor" (`0`) (see batterystats `Wss`).

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Device Temperatures

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort regularly collects several device temperature metrics, from the
[HardwarePropertiesManager](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/HardwarePropertiesManager#getDeviceTemperatures(int,%20int)>):

- CPU
- Device Skin

These are reported with min/max/mean values each hour. Note that each device has
a different collection of sensors - an example device with one device skin
sensor and two CPU sensors might have a set of metrics like this:

- `temp_skin_0.max`
- `temp_skin_0.mean`
- `temp_skin_0.min`
- `temp_cpu_0.max`
- `temp_cpu_0.mean`
- `temp_cpu_0.min`
- `temp_cpu_1.max`
- `temp_cpu_1.mean`
- `temp_cpu_1.min`

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Storage Usage

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort regularly collects device storage usage metrics from the
[StorageStatsManager](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/StorageStatsManager#getFreeBytes(java.util.UUID)>)
(`getFreeBytes`/`getTotalBytes` for the primary volume):

- `storage.primary.bytes_free`
- `storage.primary.bytes_total`
- `storage.primary.bytes_used`
- `storage.primary.percentage_used`

These metrics would be good candidates for Timeseries metrics, to monitor fleet
performance over time and find outlier devices.

### Installed App Versions

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort can collect installed app versions as metrics. These can be configured on
the Memfault Settings Dashboard, on the **Data Sources** tab, by entering
package names to collect:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-configure-app-versions-min.png)

Wildcards can be used, to collect multiple apps sharing the same package root.

Each collected version is stored as a metric, prefixed with `version.`:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-app-versions-min.png)

These metrics would be good candidates for Attributes, to enable e.g. searching
for devices with a given app version installed, or checking the installed
versions on a specific device.

### System Properties

**Collected Since Bort 4.0**

Bort can collect Android System Properties. These can be configured on the
Memfault Settings Dashboard, on the **Data Sources** tab, by entering each
property to collect:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-configure-system-properties-min.png)

Each collected property is stored as a metric, prefixed with `sysprop.`:

![](/img/docs/android/metrics-system-properties-min.png)

These metrics would be good candidates for Attributes, to enable e.g. searching
for devices with a given system property, or checking the properties for a
specific device.
