## Through the Bort SDK

When configured with a Memfault Project Key, the Bort SDK will automatically
start uploading device diagnostics information into Memfault.

During development, it makes sense to configure the Bort SDK to send data at a
higher frequency. You can do this by enabling
[development mode](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#development-mode-since-bort-420)

## Using the Memfault CLI

<MemfaultCliInstallationCallout />

There are a few ways to upload data with the CLI. The following examples will
use an Organization Auth Token. Please refer to the
[Memfault CLI Authentication](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli/#authentication)
section for more information about the different forms of authentication.

### Uploading a MAR file

A Memfault Archive File (MAR) is an archive format that is generated by the Bort
SDK containing many files in a compressed ZIP archive. The rationale behind
creating and using a bundle containing many files is:

- To minimize data bandwidth and HTTP requests for cellular devices and minimize
  CPU and power consumption for battery-operated devices.
- To make it easier for customers to send large amounts of device-generated data
  to Memfault.
- To be able to send Memfault-specific data alongside the raw files that the
  operating system creates, such as
  [Android Tombstone files](https://source.android.com/docs/core/tests/debug#debuggerd).
- To be able to associate data within a MAR file to multiple devices. This
  enables our
  [Android Multi-Device support](/docs/android/android-multi-device-support/).

To upload a MAR file that is located at, for example `/path/to/device-data.mar`,
run the appropriate command:

:::note

The Software Type, Software Version, Hardware Version, and Device Serial
parameters of the CLI command below should match that of the device which
generated the MAR file.

:::

```bash
$ memfault \
    --org-token <Memfault-Project-Key> \
    --org <ORG_SLUG> \
    --project <PROJ_SLUG> \
    upload-mar /path/to/device-data.mar
    --software-type "android-build"
    --software-version <DEVICE SOFTWARE VERSION>
    --hardware-version <DEVICE HARDWARE VERSION>
    --device-serial <DEVICE SERIAL NUMBER>
```

### Uploading a Bug Report

To upload a bugreport.zip file that is located at, for example
`/path/to/bugreport.zip`, run the appropriate command:

```bash
$ memfault \
    --org-token <Memfault-Project-Key> \
    --org <ORG_SLUG> \
    --project <PROJ_SLUG> \
    upload-bugreport /path/to/bugreport.zip
```

## Uploading Diagnostic Data via API

Please consult the
[HTTP API Upload documentation](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#2d08c7d6-fc5e-4fc7-ac77-9d72e58ba7aa)
for details on how to upload files to Memfault using the API.

## Using the Memfault UI

:::note

Only bug reports can be uploaded through the Memfault web application UI at this
time.

:::

You may upload individual bug reports via the Memfault UI by navigating to the
**Issues** page and selecting **Manual Upload**.
