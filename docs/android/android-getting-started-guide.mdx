This tutorial will cover integrating the [Bort SDK](android-bort.mdx) into a
system running Android 10.

## Integration Steps

<ProjectAwareCreateAProject />

### Clone Bort SDK

Using a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) client, clone the `bort` repository from:

```
https://github.com/memfault/bort.git
```

Add this repo to your tree at `vendor/memfault/bort` (i.e. add it to your repo
manifest).

### Patch the SDK

Apply [AOSP patches](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/master/patches) using
the `bort_cli.py` tool (requires Python 3.6+).

```
vendor/memfault/bort/bort_cli.py patch-aosp \
  --android-release 10 \
  <AOSP_ROOT>
```

Decide on an application ID for the Bort application. By placing the application
under your domain, you may later upload it to the Google Play Store if
necessary. We suggest appending `bort` to your
[reverse domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).
For example, `com.mycorp.bort`.

The OTA application ID must also be set, if using the
[OTA Update Client](android-ota-update-client.mdx). For example,
`com.mycorp.bort.ota`.

Patch the default application ID with your own:

```
vendor/memfault/bort/bort_cli.py patch-bort \
  --bort-app-id <YOUR_BORT_APPLICATION_ID> \
  --bort-ota-app-id <YOUR_BORT_OTA_APPLICATION_ID> \
  <AOSP_ROOT>/vendor/memfault/bort/MemfaultPackages
```

This command will patch `bort.properties`, setting the
`BORT_APPLICATION_ID`/`BORT_OTA_APPLICATION_ID` properties to
`<YOUR_BORT_APPLICATION_ID>`. The `--bort-ota-app-id`/`BORT_OTA_APPLICATION_ID`
is not required, if not using the OTA Update Client.

### Add the SDK Components to your build

:::note

We recommend placing the `include`s below at the _end_ of the respective
`Makefile`s. This is because `include` directives are used to _append_ to
variables in the build script; placing them at the end of the file reduces the
chances that subsequent lines in the `Makefile` do not redefine those variables
and discard the effect of the `include`. If it is not possible to place the
`include` at the end of the file, ensure that the respective variables are not
redefined (look for the `:=` syntax).

:::

Add this line to your `device.mk` file to get the components included in your
build; this appends to the `PRODUCT_PACKAGES` variable:

```
include vendor/memfault/bort/product.mk
```

Add this line to your `BoardConfig.mk` file to get the sepolicy files picked up
by the build system; this appends to the `BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS` and
`BOARD_PLAT_PRIVATE_SEPOLICY_DIR` variables:

```
include vendor/memfault/bort/BoardConfig.mk
```

### Configure the Bort & UsageReporter apps

**You must set your Project Key in the Bort app**. This is set in
`MemfaultPackages/bort.properties`; the app will not compile without this
property.

We also recommend updating the other properties as necessary, for example,
updating the SDK levels to match the API level of your OS and updating the build
tools version to what is available in your environment.

If your devices will have
[Google Mobile Services (GMS)](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/gms/) and must
run the
[Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts),
you may need to **update the Bort target SDK version** to match the API level of
your OS. This can be done by updating the `TARGET_SDK_VERSION` property in
`MemfaultPackages/bort.properties`.

Additional settings can be configured via the Bort SDK over-the-air
[SDK settings](android-bort.mdx#features-and-configuration) system.

One setting that is worth calling out, is the option to capture "minimal" bug
reports. If system load or bandwidth are concerns for your deployment, we
recommend using [minimal mode](android-bort.mdx#minimal-mode).

You must provide the Android SDK location for gradle. This can either be set
with the `ANDROID_HOME` env var, or by opening the project with Android Studio
(e.g. opening the root `build.gradle`) which will auto-generate a
`local.properties` file with the `sdk.dir` property.

### Create a keystore for the Bort app

**The bort app requires a Java keystore file so that the app can be signed**.

Instructions on how to create a keystore in Android Studio can be found
[here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).
If you plan to update the app via the Play Store, you may wish to follow the
additional instructions on that page.

:::caution

- The key that is used to sign the Bort app must NOT be the platform signing
  key, otherwise updates to the Bort app may be rejected by the Play Store.
- The key must ONLY be used to sign the Bort app and no other apps. Special
  permissions are assigned to Bort based on the signing certificate.

:::

Once you have a keystore, set up a `keystore.properties` file and provide the
path to it via the `bort.properties` file:

```
BORT_KEYSTORE_PROPERTIES_PATH=keystore.properties
```

The `keystore.properties` file must contain these properties:

```
keyAlias=myKey # e.g. key0
keyPassword=mySecretKeyPassword
storeFile=myKeystore.jks
storePassword=mySecretStorePassword
```

### Create a keystore for the OTA Update Client app

**This step is only required if using the
[OTA Update Client](android-ota-update-client.mdx)**

If using the OTA Update Client, a separate keystore should be created, following
the same steps as for the Bort app.

Once you have a keystore, set up a `ota_keystore.properties` file and provide
the path to it via the `bort.properties` file:

```
BORT_OTA_KEYSTORE_PROPERTIES_PATH=ota_keystore.properties
```

### Build the Bort APK

The `MemfaultBort` app is built using gradle. Building the release APK will
automatically invoke a task to copy the resulting APK and place it in the root
directory where it will be picked up by the AOSP build system.

```
cd MemfaultPackages && ./gradlew :bort:assembleRelease # Or gradlew :bort:assembleRelease on Windows
```

This will create a signed `MemfaultBort.apk` and `MemfaultBort.x509.pem` file.
The `pem` file is a public certificate used by the system when enforcing the SE
policy.

### Build the OTA Update Client APK

The `MemfaultBortOta` app is built using gradle. Building the release APK will
automatically invoke a task to copy the resulting APK and place it in the root
directory where it will be picked up by the AOSP build system.

```
cd MemfaultPackages && ./gradlew :bort-ota:assembleRelease # Or gradlew :bort-ota:assembleRelease on Windows
```

This will create a signed `MemfaultBortOta.apk` and `MemfaultBortOta.x509.pem`
file. The `pem` file is a public certificate used by the system when enforcing
the SE policy.

### Build the UsageReporter APK

The `MemfaultUsageReporter` app is built using gradle. Building the release APK
will automatically invoke a task to copy the resulting APK and place it in the
root directory where it will be picked up by the AOSP build system.

```
cd MemfaultPackages && ./gradlew :reporter:assembleRelease # Or gradlew :reporter:assembleRelease on Windows
```

## Validating the SDK Integration

The `bort_cli.py` tool can be used to check for issues with the SDK
installation. To use it, install a build containing the Bort SDK on a device
that you wish to validate. Connect that device via ADB (verify via
`adb devices`) and run the script:

```bash
./bort_cli.py validate-sdk-integration --bort-app-id your.app.id
```

If you have multiple devices connected, use the `--device` flag to specify the
target device. For more information on the different options, run the command
with the `-h` flag:

```bash
./bort_cli.py validate-sdk-integration -h
```

## Enable the SDK

By default, the Bort SDK will only run after being explicitly enabled at
runtime; this is to ensure no data is collected without user consent.

More information on enabling the SDK can be found in the
[Enabling the SDK at Runtime](android-bort.mdx#enabling-the-sdk-at-runtime)
section of the Bort SDK documentation.

For the purposes of testing the SDK on a development device, the SDK can be
enabled via ADB using the CLI tool:

```
./bort_cli.py enable-bort --bort-app-id your.app.id
```

## Upload a bug report

Once the SDK has been enabled, you can manually trigger a bug report to be
generated. Once generated, it will be automatically uploaded to Memfault:

```
./bort_cli.py request-bug-report --bort-app-id your.app.id
```

More information on triggering a bug report can be found in
[Triggering A Bug Report Programmatically](/docs/android/android-bort#triggering-a-bug-report-programmatically);
more information on when bug reports are automatically captured can be found in
[Bug Report Capture Period](/docs/android/android-bort#bug-report-capture-period).

Once the bug report has been generated, uploaded and processed successfully, you
will be able to find it in Memfault by navigating to the `Fleet > Devices` view
and finding the device that uploaded the bug report.

If you do not see the bug report, you can check your project's `Queue Status`
feature in the top right hand side of the `Issues` page. This shows a list of
bug reports that were recently received and their processing status.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some steps to assist in diagnosing some possible integration failures.

### System components missing during validation

If the validation is failing due to missing system components, verify if the
components are being built by searching the build artifacts.

```shell script
$ find $AOSP_ROOT/out/ -iname "MemfaultDumpstateRunner"
...
out/target/product/$YOUR_PRODUCT/system/bin/MemfaultDumpstateRunner
...
```

If the binary is not being built, then verify the `Makefile` configuration:

- Is the bort `product.mk` file included in your `device.mk` file?
  - Note that this include appends to the `PRODUCT_PACKAGES` variable: is this
    variable being redefined elsewhere via an assignment? (`:=`) after including
    the `product.mk` file?
- Is the bort `BoardConfig.mk` file being included in your `BoardConfig.mk`
  file? Similar to `PRODUCT_PACKAGES`, verify that the `BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS` and
  `BOARD_PLAT_PRIVATE_SEPOLICY_DIR` variables are not being over-written. This
  could be solved by:
  - Placing this include at the end of the file, or
  - Ensuring subsequent assignments append to these variables (`+=` not `:=`).

If you have confirmed the binary is being built, the next step is to verify if
the binary is inside the (system) image as expected. To do this, you can mount
the system image and search inside it. You should see the following files
included in the system image:

```shell script
$ sudo find /path/to/volume/ -iname memfault\*
/path/to/volume/system/priv-app/MemfaultUsageReporter
/path/to/volume/system/priv-app/MemfaultUsageReporter/MemfaultUsageReporter.apk
...
/path/to/volume/system/priv-app/MemfaultBort
...
/path/to/volume/system/priv-app/MemfaultBort/MemfaultBort.apk
/path/to/volume/system/bin/MemfaultDumpstateRunner
/path/to/volume/system/bin/MemfaultDumpster
/path/to/volume/system/etc/init/memfault_dumpster.rc
/path/to/volume/system/etc/init/memfault_init.rc
```

If these files are not present, then there may be an issue with your build
process, you may be inspecting the wrong system image, or the SDK may be
included in a different image.

### Bug report is generated but fails to upload

If the SDK is enabled, a bug report is generated, but the logcat logs show that
the upload has failed, then
[capture](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report#bugreportadb)
and upload a bug report manually over ADB so that we can assist with a detailed
investigation:

```shell script
$ adb bugreport upload-failure.zip
```

Then navigate to `Issues` in Memfault and upload the bug report via the
`Manual Upload` button in the top right hand side.

### Bug report contains fewer logs than expected

If you are viewing logs from a bug report and the timespan covered by the logcat
logs or device timeline is less than expected, this may be because:

1. The device recently rebooted and its non-persistent data was wiped.
2. The system is logging a lot (being very "chatty") and is quickly filling up
   the buffer, causing older logs to be quickly evicted.

Logcat logs are collected by `dumpstate` with the command:

```text
logcat -v threadtime -v printable -v uid -d *:v
```

This means that the bug report will collect whatever logs are available in the
system buffer. Making the logs less chatty or increasing the size of the log
buffer are two possible solutions.

Making the logs less chatty is likely to be the
[more effective solution](https://cs.android.com/android/_/android/platform/system/core/+/01c8eccca3f7c7ed9f08fdc7bb641ab40ac833d1:logd/README.property;l=30-34;drc=7a5cbfc645909a7c7ad6f33a67a34d7a396fb46b).
However, you can quickly evaluate effect of changing the size of the log buffer
over `adb` using `logcat -G`
([docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat#options)). Note
that this setting is transient and will be lost when the system reboots. To
change the log buffer size permanently, use the `persist.logd.size`
[system property](https://chromium.googlesource.com/aosp/platform/system/core/+/refs/heads/master/logd/README.property#27);
