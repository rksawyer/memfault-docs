In this guide we will walk through the steps for integrating the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) into
a project using the nRF Connect SDK. The integration has been tested against the
[v1.4.0 nRF Connect SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/v1.4.0)
release.

Upon completion of the integration, the following subcomponents will be added to
your system!

- [Reboot Reason Tracking](/docs/embedded/reboot-reason-tracking)

## Integration Steps

:::caution 
This tutorial assumes you have a working
[nRF Connect SDK Environment](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html#getting-started)
and are able to flash a board supported by the SDK (i.e nRF91, nRF53, nRF52,
etc)
:::

### Add memfault-firmware-sdk to nrf/west.yml

You will first need to add the memfault-firmware-sdk to your projects manifest.
By default, for the nRF Connect SDK this is located at `nrf/west.yml`:

```diff
diff --git a/west.yml b/west.yml
index 17071f47..84bb97f0 100644
--- a/west.yml
+++ b/west.yml
@@ -112,6 +114,10 @@ manifest:
     - name: Alexa-Gadgets-Embedded-Sample-Code
       path: modules/alexa-embedded

+      revision: master
```

:::caution
There's a couple lines in this file that look similar. Make sure you
have added this under the "projects:" level.
:::

You will then need to run `west update` to clone the memfault-firmware-sdk:

```bash
$ west update
# ...
=== updating memfault-firmware-sdk (modules/memfault-firmware-sdk):
--- memfault-firmware-sdk: initializing
Initialized empty Git repository in modules/memfault-firmware-sdk/.git/
--- memfault-firmware-sdk: fetching, need revision master
```

### Add Memfault to Project's CMakeLists.txt

Add the following **before the `find_package(...)`** line in your project's
CMakeLists.txt

```c
list(APPEND ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE}/../modules/memfault-firmware-sdk/ports/nrf-connect-sdk)
# Note: A line like "find_package(Zephyr HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})" should be below
```

### Update Kconfig selections in prj.con

Add the appropriate options to your systems `prj.conf`:

```
# project specific configuration settings

CONFIG_MEMFAULT=y

# Add to pick up support for sending Memfault data over HTTP
CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_ENABLE=y

# NRF9160 only, uses modem to store root CA's
CONFIG_MEMFAULT_ROOT_CERT_STORAGE_NRF9160_MODEM=y
```

### Zephyr Patch (nRF Connect SDK < 1.4 only)

nRF Connect SDK 1.4 and above include a
[Zephyr patch](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/27496/commits/5c1ea3f96b496a82cea89053eb4d2aedef1cde88)
that enables collection of full register state when a crash takes place.

For older SDK versions, you need to apply the patch yourself. For convenience,
we have included the patch in the memfault-firmware-sdk:

```bash
$ cd ${ZEPHYR_BASE}
$ git apply ${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/zephyr/v2.x/coredump-support.patch
```

### Create a Project and Get Project API Key

Go to https://app.memfault.com/ and from the "Select A Project" dropdown, click
on "Create Project" to setup your first project such as "smart-sink-dev".

Then navigate to "Settings" -> "General", where you can find the "Project API
Key" which will be used to communicate with Memfault's web services.

### Implement Platform Dependencies

In order to save traces, you will need to implement a dependency function that
tells memfault version information. You can add this to the `main.c` for the app
being built or a file of it's own.

```c
#include "memfault/core/platform/device_info.h"

void memfault_platform_get_device_info(sMemfaultDeviceInfo *info) {
  // platform specific version information
  *info = (sMemfaultDeviceInfo) {
    .device_serial = "DEMOSERIAL,
    .software_type = "main-mcu-fw",
    .software_version = "1.0.0",
    .hardware_version = "pvt",
  };
}
```

### Implement NRF9160 Platform Dependencies

Add the Project API Key and install the Root CA's used by Memfault:

```c
#include "memfault/http/http_client.h"

sMfltHttpClientConfig g_mflt_http_client_config = {
  .api_key = "<PROJECT_API_KEY>",
};
```

And call `memfault_nrfconnect_port_install_root_certs();` prior to calling
`lte_lc_init_and_connect()`:

```c
#include "memfault/nrfconnect_port/http.h"

void main(void) {
   // ...

   memfault_nrfconnect_port_install_root_certs();

   lte_lc_init_and_connect();
   // ...
```

### Create trace reasons definition file

The
[trace event](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/core/include/memfault/core/trace_event.h)
module within the SDK makes it easy to track errors in a way that requires less
storage than full coredump traces and also allows the system to keep running
after capturing the event. The program counter, return address and a custom
"reason" are saved.

The list of custom reasons is defined in a separate file that you need to
create.

The file _must_ be named `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` and placed in a
directory included in your project.

```bash
$ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
$ mkdir config
$ touch config/memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
```

And then in your project's `CMakeLists.txt` add:

```
zephyr_include_directories(config)
```

To start, we recommend adding a couple reasons for error paths in your codebase
(such as peripheral bus read/write failures, transport errors and unexpected
timeouts).

Here is what the `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` file should look like:

```c
// your_project/config/memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(your_custom_error_reason_1)
// i.e
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(critical_log)
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(flash_error)
// ...
```

### Generate Some Trace Events

Next, we'll need to use the `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT` macro to capture a trace
event when an error occurs.

Note that it is perfectly fine to use the same reason in different places.
Because the program counter and return address are captured in the trace event,
you will be able to see the two topmost frames (function name, source file and
line) in Memfault's Issue UI and distinguish between the two.

The nRF Connect SDK port also exposes a `mflt trace` CLI command which can be
used to generate events for test purposes:

```
uart:~$ mflt trace
<dbg> <mflt>: Trace Event Generated!
```

You can also start to add trace events for error paths you are interested in
tracking:

```c
#include "memfault/core/trace_event.h"
// [ ...]
void ble_le_process_ll_pkt(...) {
  // ...
  if (invalid_msg_id) {
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(bt_invalid_msg_id);
    // ...
  }
  // ..
}
```

Log metadata can also be added to a trace event to capture additional info:

```c
void record_temperature(...) {
  int rv = spi_flash_erase(...);
  if (rv != 0) {
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(flash_error, "Flash Erase Failure: rv=%d, spi_err=0x%x",
      spi_bus_get_status());
  }
}
```

### Publish data to the Memfault cloud

#### (nRF9160) HTTPS

When HTTP is available, you can use the Memfault integration to post data from
the CLI (`mflt post_chunks`) or by adding a periodic task:

```c
#include "memfault/nrfconnect_port/http.h"

void some_periodic_task(void) {
  memfault_nrfconnect_port_post_data();
}
```

#### Bluetooth

Extensive details about how data from the Memfault SDK makes it to the cloud
[can be found here](data-from-firmware-to-cloud.md). In short, the Memfault SDK
packetizes data into "chunks" that must be pushed to the Memfault cloud via the
[chunk REST endpoint](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?version=latest#66b0e390-2c3e-4c0d-b6c2-836a287b9e5f).

A typical integration looks like this:

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_packetizer.h"
// [...]

bool try_send_memfault_data(void) {
  // buffer to copy chunk data into
  uint8_t buf[USER_CHUNK_SIZE];
  size_t buf_len = sizeof(buf);

  bool data_available = memfault_packetizer_get_chunk(buf, &buf_len);
  if (!data_available ) {
    return false; // no more data to send
  }

  // send payload collected to chunks endpoint
  user_transport_send_chunk_data(buf, buf_len);
  return true;
}

void send_memfault_data(void) {
  // [... user specific logic deciding when & how much data to send
  while (try_send_memfault_data()) { }
}
```

### Force a Crash and Upload to Memfault

Example crashes can be generated using the `mflt` CLI:

```bash
uart:~$ mflt crash
# ...
*** Booting Zephyr OS build v2.4.0-ncs1  ***
<inf> <mflt>: GNU Build ID: ef460cafbcf67633d470c125a7cc8fd02ed97538
Memfault Demo App Started!
uart:~$ mflt get_core
<inf> <mflt>: Has coredump with size: 3764
```

On nRF91 you can post directly to the cloud:

```bash
uart:~$ mflt post_chunks
<dbg> <mflt>: Response Complete: Parse Status 0 HTTP Status 202!
<dbg> <mflt>: Body: Accepted
<dbg> <mflt>: No more data to send
```

#### Test Tip

Data can also also be dumped out over the CLI using the `mflt export_data` CLI
command.

```bash
uart:~$ mflt export_data
<inf> <mflt>: MC:SFQCpwIBAwEHalRFU1RTRVJJQUwKbXRlc3Qtc29mdHdhcmUJajEuMC4wLXRlcw==:
<inf> <mflt>: MC:gCx0Bm10ZXN0LWhhcmR3YXJlBKEBoXJjaHVua190ZXN0X3N1Y2Nlc3MBMeQ=:
```

The CLI output can then be saved to a file and the "chunk" data can be posted to
the Memfault Cloud using the [Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli):

```bash
$ memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY} post-chunk --encoding sdk_data_export cli-output.txt
Found 2 Chunks. Sending Data ...
Success
```

### Upload Symbol File

At this point you should be able to generate a test trace event and push it to
the Memfault UI. You can confirm the issue has arrived succesfully by navigating
to the "Issues" page. Follow the link pointed to below and upload a symbol file.

![](/img/docs/embedded/first-trace.png)

After this step you will see the trace in the list of issues!

:::tip
You can programatically upload symbol files with the
[Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli).

### Troubleshooting Data Transfer

If you run into any issues with your data transfer implementation, we have tools
to help!

- A UI you can use to
  [view the raw "Chunk" data payloads](/docs/embedded/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint#troubleshooting)
  that have arrived for your project.
- [Precanned Data Payloads](/docs/embedded/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint)
  you can pass through your `user_transport_send_chunk_data()` implementation to
  test data transfer in isolation.
- A [GDB Script](/docs/embedded/test-data-collection-with-gdb) which can be
  installed to send chunks programatically every time a breakpoint is hit.
