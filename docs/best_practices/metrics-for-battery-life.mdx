Memfault believes that the expected and the actual battery life of devices are
two of the most important reliability metrics for devices that are not connected
directly to power sources. Unfortunately, understanding and predicting battery
life trends and regressions with thousands to millions of devices in the field
is _hard_.

In this guide, we will walk through the benefits of tracking battery life with
Memfault, how to understand and predict battery life for a single device as well
as across an entire fleet of devices, and finally talk through common pitfalls
when monitoring battery life.

## Tracking Battery Life with Memfault

By using Memfault's device SDKs and the heartbeat metrics, the difficulties of
monitoring battery life will become a problem of the past. Memfault provides two
main benefits when it comes to monitoring battery life: the ability to view a
single device's battery status over time, and the ability to understand battery
trends across an entire fleet of devices.

The above view shows a device-level view of battery life over time. This view is
best for customer support teams responding to customer issues around battery
life and for engineers trying to determine the root causes for poor battery life
on a single device.

    alt="Memfault metric for battery charge level drop"
  />
</p>

The above view shows the average battery life drop per hour of all devices in a
fleet between software versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1. Even though small, there is a
larger battery life drop on average for software version 1.0.1, which could
signal a regression in firmware!

The above examples give you a quick idea of the capabilities of Memfault. Let's
begin on how to get started digging into battery life on your devices using
Memfault.

## Steps to Track Battery Life

### Android

If you are using the [Bort SDK](/docs/android/android-bort), the relevant
battery metrics are automatically reported and you can skip down to...

### MCU & Linux

Two metrics need to be recorded within the MCU or Linux firmware to ensure that
you can reliably track battery life at a device and fleet level. These two
metrics are the charge level, or
[state of charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge), of a device at
the end of a heartbeat interval, and the charge level drop over the course of a
heartbeat interval, where the heartbeat interval is a consistent, fixed interval
of time.

#### Current Battery Charge Level

This value represents the current charge level of the battery in the system.
This value should be linearly normalized between 0 and 10,000.

A value of -1 should be sent when the battery charge level can not be obtained
or is known to be invalid.

:::info

This value should be based on a linear scale. Millivolts should not be sent.

:::

##### Setup Within Memfault

- It is recommended to use the name `Battery_ChargeLevel` for this metric name.
- **Range** should be set to 0 - 10,000.
- **Ignore** should be set to -1.
- **Attribute** should be enabled, and the **Write Policy** should be set to
  Writeable.
- **Time Series** should be disabled.

    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-charge-level-metric.png"
    alt="Memfault metric for battery charge level drop"
  />
</p>

##### Example Metric Recordings

- To report a battery charge level of 50%, record 5,000.
- To report a battery charge level of 50 mAh out of a 500 mAh capacity battery,
  record 1,000.
- If the battery charge level could not be acquired or it is known to be
  invalid, record -1.

#### Battery Level Drop Over Interval

This value represents the amount the battery charge level dropped within the
heartbeat interval, normalized between 0 to 10,000. This can also be interpreted
as the first derivative of the
[current battery charge level](#current-battery-charge-level).

This metric _should report an invalid reading of -1_ if a charger or other power
source was connected at any point during the heartbeat interval.

A value of -1 should be sent when the battery charge level drop can not be
obtained, is known to be invalid, or happens to be negative.

##### Setup Within Memfault

- It is recommended to use the name `Battery_ChargeLevelDrop` for this metric
  name.
- **Range** should be set to 0 - 10,000.
- **Ignore** should be set to -1.
- **Attribute** should be disabled.
- **Time Series** should be enabled.

    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-charge-level-drop-metric.png"
    alt="Memfault metric for battery charge level drop"
  />
</p>

##### Example Metric Recordings

- To report a drop from 87% to 84% over the course of the heartbeat interval,
  report 300.
- To report a battery charge level drop of 10 mAh out of a 500 mAh capacity
  battery, record 2000.
- If the battery charge level drop could not be acquired or it is known to be
  invalid or negative, record -1.

#### Implementing Battery Metrics in Code

Below is C pseudocode that can be used to track the current
[battery charge level](#current-battery-charge-level) and
[battery charge level drop](#battery-level-drop-over-interval) over a given
heartbeat interval.

```c
// Stores the battery charge level from the start of the heartbeat interval
static int32_t s_battery_charge_level_previous;

// Tracks whether a charger was connected during the heartbeat interval
static bool s_battery_charger_event_during_interval;

// Called at the start of a heartbeat interval
static void prv_device_metrics_start_heartbeat() {
    // Sets the battery percentage at the start of the interval
    s_battery_charge_level_previous = battery_get_current_pct();

    // Determine whether a charger is connected at this exact moment.
    // If the charger is connected during the hour, this should be
    // updated by the battery/charging module too.
    s_battery_charger_event_during_interval = battery_get_charger_connected();
}

// Calculate and record the drop in battery charge over the heartbeat interval
static void prv_metrics_heartbeat_record_battery_info() {
    // Charge level normalized between 0 and 10,000
    const int32_t battery_charge_level = battery_charge_level_get();

    // Subtract current charge level from previous charge level to get
    // a drop in battery charge level normalized between 0 and 10,000
    const int32_t battery_charge_drop = battery_charge_level - s_battery_charge_level_previous;

    const bool report_battery_drop = (s_charger_connected_during_hour || battery_charge_drop < 0);

    if (report_battery_drop) {
        memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_signed(
            MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(Battery_ChargeLevelDrop),
            battery_charge_drop
        );
    } else {
        // Don't report this metric during hours with charging events
        // Make sure to set up -1 as the value to ignore in the Memfault service
        memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_signed(
            MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(Battery_ChargeLevelDrop),
            -1
        );
    }

    // Also record the current battery charge level
    memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_signed(
        MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(Battery_ChargeLevel),
        battery_charge_level
    );
}
```

## Analyzing Battery Life for a Single Device

Viewing an individual device's battery life over time is usually the first step
during a customer support or engineering debugging session when trying to
diagnose poor battery performance.

In Memfault, a device's battery life can be found under **Devices** then
**Timeline**.

The Memfault application also shows other important metrics alongside battery
life, which might point out correlations between battery charge drops and other
events, such as the screen backlight being on, the Wi-Fi radio being stuck in a
particular state, or the CPU not sleeping enough.

### Android

For Android devices, you can navigate to the **Device Timeline** tab in the
application and view the "Battery Level" metric to view the battery charge level
over time.

<p align="center">

    width="700"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery-level-timeline.png"
    alt="Memfault Android metric for battery charge level drop"
  />
</p>

### MCU & Embedded Linux

For MCU & Embedded Linux devices, you can navigate to the **Device Timeline**
tab in the application and view the specific battery metrics that your devices
are configured to send. If this guide was followed, the metric would be called
`Battery_ChargeLevel`.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="700"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-battery-level-timeline.png"
    alt="Memfault MCU & Embedded Linux metric for battery charge level"
  />
</p>

## Analyzing Battery Life for a Fleet of Devices

A requirement of battery-operated devices is that they meet a minimum expected
battery life. If a smartwatch promised to last 7 days under normal usage, it
should ideally last 7 days or more in real-world environments.

Fleet-wide battery trends can also be easily analyzed within Memfault.

### Android

For Android projects and devices, a metric
`battery_discharge_rate_pct_per_hour_avg` is created automatically. It
represents the battery charge level drop per hour represented as a percentage.
Below, we create a chart for this metric.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery-discharge-rate-per-hour.png"
    alt="Android discharge rate per hour metric chart"
  />
</p>

In the next section, we'll talk about how to use this chart.

### MCU & Embedded Linux

For MCU & Embedded Linux projects, we receive the metric representing the
battery charge level drop over the course of the heartbeat interval for all
devices. Below, we create a chart for this metric.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-battery-charge-level-drop-chart.png"
    alt="Android discharge rate per hour metric chart"
  />
</p>

In the next section, we'll talk about how to use this chart.

## Predicting Expected Battery Life

Once we have the average drop in the battery charge level over time, we can
easily calculate the number of hours of battery life that our devices should
expect on average!

For our calculations below, we'll assume that all heartbeat intervals are _one
hour_.

$$
Projected\ \#\ Hours\ of\ Battery\ Life = \frac{100}{Average\ Battery\ Charge\ Drop\ Per\ Hour}
$$

For example, if the average battery charge drop per hour was 1.2.

$$
\frac{100}{2.2} = 45.5\ hours\ of\ expected\ battery\ life
$$

## Common Battery Life Pitfalls

Here are some common pitfalls with monitoring battery life that many of us at
Memfault have struggled with in the past. We hope you don't make the same
mistakes with this knowledge.

### Ignoring Charging Status During Heartbeat Interval

A common issue with reporting battery life information from devices is that the
power state is ignored. Battery life statistics that are used in aggregations
should not be taken into account if a device is currently plugged in or
charging.

For example, the chart below shows the battery life of a device over a span of
time:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-life-drop.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

The battery is discharging around 10% per data point. However, there is one
chunk of time where there is a large battery life drop, but the device is
plugged into a charger quickly and by the time the next battery life report
takes place, it's been charged and is reporting a normal-looking number again.
It might look as if the battery regression never took place!

The same goes for a device that is reporting data for long periods while
connected to a charger. It might report 100% for 3 days, and these calculations
should not be taken into account when determining battery life calculations for
a fleet of devices.

### Sending Current Battery Life Sporadically

Firmware could be configured to send up battery life information at a
non-standard interval. It may be whenever it connects to Wi-Fi, when it's within
Bluetooth range of a cell phone, or when it's asked by a remote server for
information.

In this information report, a device would usually send the current battery life
percentage according to a pre-determined curve or a millivolt reading.

This type of information is decent when looking at a single device's history of
battery life, but that is about it. From these individual reports, and sporadic
reports at that, a battery life drop might be missed entirely, such as in the
chart below:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-scattered-data-points.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

When only taking into account the four captured data points, the battery life
looks like it drops at a normal rate. However, there was a large drop in the
middle.

### Not Waiting For Battery Measure to Settle

Batteries are quirky devices, and we don't have perfect tools at our disposal to
get accurate readings from them at all times. Often, the voltage from the
battery is used to come up with a guess as to the charge level of the battery.

Reading the voltage works well if the battery draw has been stable and continues
to be stable, but the battery may experience a voltage drop during a sudden high
current draw, such as the backlight being turned on or a vibration motor
suddenly activating.

In these situations, you need to be extra careful to avoid using the battery
charge level reading during an event of a voltage drop. To mitigate this, it is
advised to take a handful of samples at both the start and end of heartbeat
intervals, each sample being a few seconds apart. Of these samples, the outliers
can be discarded or all samples can be averaged to come up with a more stable
reading.

## Preventing Battery Life Regressions

The only real way to prevent battery life regressions reliably and quickly is to
measure the metrics mentioned above on devices in a production environment on
production firmware. It is impossible to run devices and firmware through the
entire matrix of environmental conditions to understand real-world power usage.

This means that if a company makes a wearable device and it's shipped all over
the world, it should be tested internally with a variety of Android and iOS
phones, versions, connectivity interference, and usage patterns, but it should
be understood that this will only be a small subset of the environments the
device will experience.

The only proper way to understand battery life is to push out an update to a
small percentage of the fleet of devices, maybe 1%, and gather data. Below, we
are comparing an existing firmware, 1.0.0, with a new firmware that has recently
begun rolling out to devices, 1.1.0.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="600"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-life-regression.png"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

We can quickly see that the battery charge level drop on 1.1.0 is, on average,
_much worse_ than on 1.0.0. If this was unexpected, this is a regression!

This release should be pulled and more investigation needs to be done to
understand the root cause for the new battery life drain behavior.
