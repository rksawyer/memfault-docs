This tutorial will cover integrating the Memfault Linux SDK into your system.
This getting-started guide is designed with systems in mind that are built using
[Yocto][yocto-homepage], but generic instructions are included for other setups.

After you're done, you should have a basic integration setup that can talk to
the Memfault cloud, enabling one or more of the following features:

- Reporting reboot events to Memfault.
- Reporting [Metrics][docs-linux-metrics].
- [Over-the-air (OTA) updates][docs-linux-ota].

## Useful links

- The [source for the Memfault Linux SDK][source-sdk]. Make sure to use the
  [branch matching the Yocto release][source-sdk-branches] that you are using.
- A [sample integration using Yocto][source-yocto-example].
- [Reference: `memfaultd` Configuration][docs-configuration].
- [Reference: `memfaultd` CLI][docs-cli].

## Assumptions and dependencies

- Currently, our SDK is centered around [Yocto][yocto-homepage] and is verified
  to work on these releases of Yocto:
  - [`4.0 kirkstone`][yocto-kirkstone]
  - [`3.1 dunfell`][yocto-dunfell]
- Your project uses [`systemd`][systemd-homepage] as the init system.

Optionally, as requirements of plugins:

- For [OTA][docs-linux-ota]:
  - [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] as an OTA updates client.
  - [U-Boot][u-boot-homepage], since SWUpdate depends on it.
- For [Custom Metrics][docs-linux-metrics]:
  - [CollectD][collectd-homepage] to collect and upload metrics.

## Integration steps

<ProjectAwareCreateAProject />

### Include `memfaultd` in your build

:::tip

Keep [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example] open as a reference
implementation. Your integration should look similar to it once you're done
following the steps in this tutorial.

:::

The `memfaultd` service is the main orchestrator of the subsystems that conform
and are used by the Memfault Linux SDK. As with all our SDKs, its [source code
is available on GitHub][source-memfaultd].

Among its responsibilities are:

- Keeping a queue of items to be uploaded to the Memfault cloud.
- Uploading that data at a specified interval, and recovering from network
  failures using an exponential back-off system, independent of the regular
  refresh interval.
- Controlling whether data is allowed to be collected (e.g. by user consent)
  from a device or not.
- Interacting with and configuring subsystems such as SWUpdate and collectd.
- Providing configuration access via [CLI][docs-cli].

`memfaultd` is required for integration.

<LinuxBuildSystemOptionsTabs>
  <TabItem value={SYSTEM_YOCTO}>

#### Add `memfaultd` and dependencies to your Yocto project

Include the [`meta-memfault`][source-meta-memfault] layer in your
`bblayers.conf` file, alongside dependencies:

```
# Apart from other layers you may already depend on:
BBLAYERS ?= " \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/memfault-linux-sdk/meta-memfault \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-swupdate \
"
```

You can grab a copy of `meta-swupdate` from [the source
repository][source-meta-swupdate]. Note that `meta-oe` is a dependency of
`meta-swupdate`.

Since `memfaultd` has a commercial license, you'll need to add an exception for
it, for example in your `local.conf`:

```
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED:append = " commercial_memfaultd"
```

Add the necessary dependencies to your image file (note that `collectd` is
[provided by `meta-oe`][source-collectd-recipe]):

```
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
    u-boot-env \
    u-boot-fw-utils \
    collectd \
"
```

Finally, to use `systemd` as an init system (using `poky`):

```
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED:append = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={SYSTEM_OTHER}>

Grab a copy of [the source code for `memfaultd`][source-memfaultd] and build
using CMake. The included `builtin.conf` contains built-in defaults for
`/etc/memfaultd.conf` and is not meant to be changed. See
[the section on `/etc/memfaultd.conf`](#add-etcmemfaultdconf-to-your-build) to
learn how to configure `memfaultd` on the target device.

```shell
cd /path/to/source/memfaultd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

  </TabItem>
</LinuxBuildSystemOptionsTabs>

#### (Optional) Opt out of `memfaultd` built-in plugins

<details>

<summary>
  The `memfaultd` daemon has a plugin system. All plugins are included by
  default, so you don't need to do anything if you want them in. However, you
  can control which plugins are included at build time.
</summary>

The available plugins are:

- `plugin-swupdate`: used for [OTA management][docs-linux-ota].
- `plugin-reboots`: used for reboot reason tracking.
- `plugin-collectd`: used for collection of [metrics][docs-linux-metrics].

<LinuxBuildSystemOptionsTabs>
  <TabItem value={SYSTEM_YOCTO}>

Set `PACKAGECONFIG` for the `memfaultd` package to control which plugins are
included in the `memfaultd` build. For example, you can add a
`memfaultd.bbappends` recipe with the following contents:

```
PACKAGECONFIG := "plugin-swupdate plugin-reboots plugin-collectd"
```

Alternatively, in your `local.conf` file:

```
PACKAGECONFIG:pn-memfaultd := "plugin-swupdate plugin-reboots plugin-collectd"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={SYSTEM_OTHER}>

The included plugins can be configured using the flags `-DENABLE_PLUGINS=1`
alongside `-DPLUGIN_REBOOT=1`, `-DPLUGIN_SWUPDATE=1` and `-DPLUGIN_COLLECTD=1`.

  </TabItem>
</LinuxBuildSystemOptionsTabs>

</details>

### Add a `memfault-device-info` executable to your build

:::tip

You may want to copy over [the entire `memfault-device-info` recipe from our
examples][source-yocto-memfault-device-info-example] to get started. Make sure
to edit its contents following the steps in this section.

:::

The `memfaultd` daemon expects to find a `memfault-device-info` executable in
`$PATH`. The `memfault-device-info` executable is created by you during
integration and is meant to provide device-specific information in order to
identify it in Memfault services. The expected output is in the following
format:

```
MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=<device-id>
MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=<hardware-version>
```

Read more about [Device ID][docs-device-id], [Software Versions, and Hardware
Versions][docs-hardware-version-software-version] to better understand these
core Memfault platform concepts.

Here's an example `memfault-device-info` shell script one might add to
`/usr/bin/memfault-device-info`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=$(cat /etc/machine-id)
echo MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=$(dmidecode -s system-product-name)
```

The script would output something like this:

```shell
$ memfault-device-info
MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=4a7d5d74-e8f0-471f-9f8c-23e3dd5ce18c
MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=some-board-rev-1.3
```

If you added a recipe named `memfault-device-info`, don't forget to add it to
your image dependencies:

```diff
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
//highlight-next-line
    memfault-device-info \
    u-boot-env \
    u-boot-fw-utils \
"
```

### Add `/etc/memfaultd.conf` to your build

:::tip

Find a [full reference on `/etc/memfaultd.conf` here][docs-configuration]. You
may want to copy over the entire [`memfaultd.bbappend` recipe from our
examples][source-yocto-memfaultd-conf-example] to get started. Make sure to edit
its contents following the steps in this section.

:::

A [default `memfaultd.conf`][source-builtin-conf] (called `builtin.conf` in the
source files) is embedded within the `memfaultd` binary, and the daemon will
fall back to it if `/etc/memfaultd.conf` does not provide an override for a
specific key. All values in it can be overwritten by adding an
`/etc/memfaultd.conf` file to your build, e.g. using a `bbappends` recipe for
`memfaultd` (see an [example][source-yocto-memfaultd-conf-example]). You may
copy parts of the built-in config (or the whole file) to customize configuration
on your target device.

Note that while the sample file has reasonable defaults for most keys, it cannot
guess a value for some fields such as `software_version`, `software_type` or
`project_key`. Hence, a minimal `/etc/memfaultd.conf` file should look like
this:

```json
{
  "software_version": "1.0.0",
  "software_type": "main",
  "project_key": "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>"
}
```

Note that `/etc/memfaultd.conf` is designed to be in a read-only filesystem.

Read more about [Software Versions and Hardware
Versions][docs-hardware-version-software-version] to better understand these
core Memfault platform concepts.

#### Configure a persistent storage directory for `memfaultd`

In `/etc/memfaultd.conf`:

```json
{
  "software_version": "1.0.0",
  "software_type": "main",
  "project_key": "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>",
  // highlight-next-line
  "data_dir": "<YOUR_PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR>"
}
```

By default it will be a directory in `/media`. You will most likely need to
change this to wherever your device stores data in a persistent manner.
Requirements for this directory are:

- That it is writable to by `memfaultd`.
- That its data persists after firmware upgrades.

### Set `enable_data_collection`

By default, `enable_data_collection` is `false` (see the [default
configuration][source-builtin-conf]). This is to enable asking end users for
consent before collecting or transmitting any data to Memfault services.

Once the end user has given their consent, you can enable data collection like
so:

```shell
$ memfaultd --enable-data-collection
```

To disable it:

```shell
$ memfaultd --disable-data-collection
```

The `memfaultd` service will restart automatically whenever you run either of
those commands.

Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for
more information.

### Test the integration

<p>
  If you've included the reboot reasons plugin, you can test your integration by
  rebooting your test device. Then, on the Memfault app, open{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/devices">
    <b>Fleet -> Devices</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  and check that your device shows up. If you open the specific device, you
  should be able to find its reboot events under the <b>Reboots</b> tab.
</p>
