This tutorial will use a Docker container to walk you through building a Yocto
image with the Memfault SDK. This image is based on Poky, Yocto's reference
distribution.

If you already have your own Yocto-based distribution, we recommend following
our [integration guide][integration-guide] to learn how to add the Memfault SDK.

[integration-guide]: /docs/linux/integration-guide/

## Build and Run Linux with Memfault SDK

### Create a Memfault Project

Go to [app.memfault.com](https://app.memfault.com) and from the "Select a
Project" dropdown, click on "Create Project". Once you're done, you can find a
project key, referenced as `YOUR_PROJECT_KEY` in this document, in the Project
settings page.

### Checkout the Memfault Linux SDK

Checkout the [Memfault Linux SDK][sdk] on your computer.

The instructions on this guide are compatible with Linux and macOS (Intel and
Apple Silicon). Windows users should be able to follow along with minimal
adjustments.

[sdk]: https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/

### Create a Docker container to build with Yocto

We provide a [`Dockerfile`][dockerfile] and a [`run.sh`][run.sh] script to
create a container.

```
$ cd /path/to/memfault-linux-sdk/docker
$ MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY=<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY> ./run.sh -b
```

### Build your Yocto-based image

This project is configured to build an image for the `arm64` architecture on a
QEMU (emulated) machine.

To build the image, run:

```
$ bitbake memfault-image
```

This will take a long time the first time. Yocto will cache compilation results
and future builds will be much faster. We use named Docker volumes to persist
source code and build artifacts beyond the container lifetime.

:::tip

If Docker seems to hang for a long time (build output not updating, CPU usage
low) you may have run out of available space allocated to Docker. Check the
Docker console for limits on system resources.

[dockerfile]:
  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/docker/Dockerfile
[run.sh]: https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/docker/run.sh

### Run the image with QEMU

To start QEMU and run the image you have just built, we provide a convenient
shortcut:

```
$ q # Run image in QEMU
// Linux boots

login: root
```

:::tip

The `q` shortcut executes our own [`runqemu.py`][runqemu] which is very similar
to `runqemu qemuarm64 slirp nographic` in newer Yocto distributions.

We maintain compatibility with older versions of Yocto in which `runqemu` did
not support the dual-copy SWUpdate setup that we use here. This is why we
provide our own.

### Inspect the integration

Login as `root` and make sure to enable data-collection (disabled by default).

```
# memfaultctl enable-data-collection
```

You can now use `memfaultctl` to generate events on the device. They will appear
in your&nbsp;<ProjectMagicLink path="/"><b>Dashboard</b></ProjectMagicLink>.

```
# memfaultctl trigger-coredump
# memfaultctl write-attributes QUICK_START=COMPLETE
# memfaultctl reboot --reason 4 # Reboot with "Low-Battery Reason"
```

:::tip

Keep in mind that to save bandwidth `memfaultd` queues events and does not
upload them immediately. To flush the queue more often you can use [developer
mode][developer-mode] and/or `memfaultctl sync`.
