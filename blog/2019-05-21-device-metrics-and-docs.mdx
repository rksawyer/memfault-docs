## Device Metric Table Improvements

You are now able to search for individual Metrics as well as select all or none
of them instantly with the click of a button.

## Device Metrics URL Linking

When you select/deselect Metrics in the Device Detail view, it will now generate
a URL with parameters `metrics[]=`. This allows you to send this URL to a
co-worker so that they can look at the same Metrics chart instantly.

## Documentation Improvements

[https://docs.memfault.com](https://docs.memfault.com) now has an example
Request/Response for nearly **every** API endpoint. We've also improved the
sections related to Authentication and Resources.

We've published two new tutorials for common use cases when using the API
directly from your Continuous Integration system. Check them out here:
