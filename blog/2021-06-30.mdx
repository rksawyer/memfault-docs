## Nordic nRF Connect SDK Memfault Integration

Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Connect SDK now has Memfault's SDK built-in, allowing
for customers and users of Nordic's chips and tools to integrate and use
Memfault in minutes.

for more information!

As for new Memfault features, we made improvements to symbol-file uploading and
downloading, added favorite projects, and sped everything up a bit.

## General

- Memfault can now surface which Devices are staged (will receive an update) in
  a staged rollout. To determine which of your Devices are staged, navigate to
  **Fleet -> Deployments** and click on **Devices** on a staged rollout
  Deployment.

  </p>

- You can now upload missing symbol files directly from the "_Unprocessed
  Traces_" dialog. If the Software Version is a development version and the
  alert can be ignored, you can also click **Archive** to archive the version
  directly.

  </p>

- Improve handling around Issue timestamps to prevent historical or future dates
  from being set as attributes of the Issue. This could happen when a device's
  clock was set to January 1970 or the year 2099!
- Symbol files and coredumps can now be downloaded directly from the Issue page,
  which means no more having to bounce between the Software and Issue pages.

- For customers with 5+ projects, you can now set a project as a "Favorite" and
  it will be automatically loaded when you go to app.memfault.com.

- Improved the performance when paging between "next" and "previous" Traces on
  an Issue.
- Improved the performance of the Reboot and Metrics charts.

## MCU

- Trace Events that were created by Software Versions which has been archived,
  will now be hidden.
- When there is an active interrupt on a Trace, the backtrace is automatically
  expanded for discoverability.
- Reduced code space utilized by metric subsystem by transitioning from a string
  representation of metric names to an enum representation.
- Removed "DST Root CA X3" from the required Memfault root certificate list as
  there is no infrastructure that relies on it anymore.
- Fixed an issue where MCU logs could fail if a timestamp was included.
- For more details on the changes to the Firmware SDK that didn't make the
  changelog, check out the
  [Memfault Firmware SDK changelog](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md).

## Android

- Initial support for Android 11 was added to the Bort SDK.
- Fixed a problem where BatteryStat-based system metrics stop being collected if
  the battery was fully charged and still plugged.
- For more details on the changes to the Android Bort SDK that didn't make the
  changelog, check out the
