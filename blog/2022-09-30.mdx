## Linux SDK 1.0 with Coredump support

[Memfault's Linux SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk) reached
version 1.0 when introducing
[support for Coredumps](/docs/linux/linux-coredumps): In the event of a crash of
any process on the system, `memfaultd` produces a memory dump that will be
uploaded to Memfault for further processing to allow for
[detailed debugging across the fleet](/docs/platform/introduction#debugging).
Together with the already existing support for OTA, metrics, and reboot reasons,
Memfault now offers all its essential features on Linux devices!

The [documentation of Memfault’s Linux SDK](/docs/linux/introduction) was
extended even further to explain the integration steps as well as the growing
number of configuration options.
