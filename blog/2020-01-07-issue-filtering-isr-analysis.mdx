title: Issue Filtering and Improved Trace Analysis
---

Happy 2020! We hope you are as excited for the new year as we are at Memfault.

In this update, we've added improved Issue filtering, automated ISR analysis, a
built-in hex viewer into the Trace viewer, and many other improvements.

## Issue List Filtering

    alt="/img/blog/2020-01-07-issue-filtering-min.png"
  />
</p>

You can now filter Issues by more fields, including Software Type, Software
Version, and Hardware Version. As you filter, the URL will update so that you
can bookmark your favorite queries.

## ARM ISR & Exception Analysis

  />
</p>

We've added an ISR analysis to our growing list of analyzers for Memfault. This
will tell you which exceptions are configured, the state and priority of them,
and provide extra notes and suggestions.

## Trace Historical Counts

<p align="center">

    alt="/img/blog/2020-01-07-issue-filtering-min.png"
  />
</p>

You can now easily view the historical counts of a given Issue.

## Hex Viewer

  />
</p>

## Other Updates

- Display function name for function pointers in the **Globals & Statics** tab
- Stack Overflows from different threads will now produce different Issues
- Better support for QP when analyzing coredumps
- Better support for ARM-MDK and IAR in the **Globals & Statics** tab
