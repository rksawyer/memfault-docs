## Device Sets

You can now observe the development of your device fleet even better via fully
customizable
[Device Sets](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#device-sets)
(Fleet→Device Sets). Based on your project-specific
[Device Attributes and Time-Series Metrics](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/metrics)
each set describes devices that match unique criteria such as “devices that
exceeded 40MB of daily network traffic” or “devices in the UK”.

You can create a Device Set from any existing device search and use them to
track key performance indicators over time.

## Issue Charts

The new chart type
[Issue Chart](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/charts#issue-charts)
complements the custom Metrics Chart (Dashboards→Metrics) and plots the number
of occurrences of a specific group of issues over time. When combined with the
recently introduced
[Chart Comparison Mode](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/charts#comparison-mode),
Issue Charts allow for sophisticated tracking of ongoing software updates to
answer the relevant question “does my software update fix the bugs it claims to
fix?”
