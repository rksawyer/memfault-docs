## Linux SDK 0.3.0 – Metrics and Diagnostics Data

Memfault's Linux support reaches another milestone: Devices can now report
metrics and diagnostic data to measure the success of software updates (OTA) and
to proactively diagnose anomalies before users even experience their effect. The
[Memfault Linux SDK 0.3.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk) ships
with a configurable set of
[plugins for collectd](/docs/linux/linux-metrics#configuring-collectd) to obtain
standard KPIs at the operating system level (e.g. available storage or RAM, CPU
utilization, or network status and traffic). You can also use the SDK to
[collect product-specific custom metrics via statsd](/docs/linux/linux-metrics#application-metrics).

When sent to the cloud, all telemetry data is being processed and distilled to
fleet-wide [time-series metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) (e.g. "was
there an uptick in avg. CPU usage since the last version?"),
[device attributes](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes) (e.g. “which devices at
site B ran for more than 6 months already without reboot?"), and detailed
per-device insights via the Timeline UI (e.g. “are there any anomalies on the
network traffic that correlate with crashes reported for this device?").

Combined with [Memfault's alerting feature](/docs/platform/alerts), operating
your fleet of Linux devices is now easier than ever!

## Improved Device Timeline

Memfault’s Device Timeline provides a view for each device’s metrics, reboots
and crashes to make debugging easier. With the recent performance improvements,
Device Timeline now renders considerably more time-series metrics simultaneously
and expandable “Panels” group relevant metrics together for ease of use (see
_Value History_, _Foreground_, _Longwakes_ below).
