## Issue Reason Filter Multi-Select

You can now filter by multiple Issue reasons at once. The filtering will persist
in the browser's localStorage and will propagate to the URL so that you can send
links to your co-workers of your favorite queries.

## Device Metrics Zoom and Normalize

We have added a zoom feature for the Device Metrics, as well as the ability to
normalize the Y-axis units. This is useful for digging into a particular moment
in time and comparing similar metrics.
