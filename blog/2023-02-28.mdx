## Memfault Support for RISC-V on ESP32-C3 Devices

Memfault now supports RISC-V on ESP32-C3 devices. By following the steps in the
[iESP32 ESP-IDF](/docs/mcu/esp32-guide/) integration guide, you will be able to
integrate the Memfault Firmware SDK into a system that is using the
[ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf), including the ESP32-C3
chip. The integration guide assumes you already have a working project/toolchain
for the ESP32. If you do not, the
[official getting started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)
is a great resource.
