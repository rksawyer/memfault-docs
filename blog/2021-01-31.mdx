## Issue Merging

Make your Issue list more organized and concise with the new Issue merging
feature! Users can now merge Issues together by clicking the Merge button on the
detail page of an Issue and then selecting which Issue to be its parent.

This workflow is especially useful when there are multiple Issues stemming from the
same root cause, such as a stack overflow that presents itself with different backtraces.

This feature is available for both Android and Real-Time products.

## New Bulk Device Import

Large numbers of devices can now be provisioned and added to cohorts at once via
CSV upload.

## MCU

- You can now download a Coredump as an .elf file, which can then be loaded into
  GDB as long as your version of GDB is compiled with coredump support. For more
  information, [reference the docs](https://mflt.io/coredump-elf-with-gdb).

- Full support for the ESP8266 (Tensilica Xtensa LX106) MCU architecture was
  added! A step-by-step integration guide can be found
  [here](https://mflt.io/esp8266-tutorial)
- Add a convenience header to the SDK which allows users to include a single
  header, `#include "memfault/components.h"`.
- In cases where a device generates both a Trace Event and a Coredump, the
  chances of receiving two emails and two new Issues is reduced. They should be
  de-duplicated.
- Fix an issue with compatibility around FreeRTOS, the FPU, and the IAR
  compiler.
- Improved support for STM32L4 and STM32F4 MCU's, NXP's MCU's, Silicon Lab's
  MCU's, and others.
- Improved support for the Mbed, nRF Connect SDK, Zephyr RTOS's.
