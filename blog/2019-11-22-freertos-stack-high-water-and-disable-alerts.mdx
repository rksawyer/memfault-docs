## FreeRTOS Stack High Water Marks

When using FreeRTOS, Memfault will now show _the high water mark_ of each
thread, as well as show when a _Stack Overflow_ has occurred on any thread. This
can be applied to any RTOS, so if this is of interest, let us know.

If an Alert becomes noisy, quickly disable it by toggling the switch.
