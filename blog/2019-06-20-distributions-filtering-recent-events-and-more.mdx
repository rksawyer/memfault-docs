## Cohort/Release/Hardware Distributions for Issues

On an Issue Detail page, it is now possible to view the Distribution of all
Traces which led to an Issue grouped by Release, Cohort, and Hardware Version.
No more guessing which groups of Devices were affected!

## View Recent Events for a Device Easily

In a Device's Detail page, it is now easy to go to the most recent Events for
that device by clicking **Events** in the upper right corner of the **Events
Seen By Day** chart.

## Cohorts View now under Fleet

We've moved the Cohorts View underneath the **Fleet** tab to better align with
the meaning of Fleet. It is now the default page to open upon login.

Device in its Details page.
