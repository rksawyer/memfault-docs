Extensive details about how data from the Memfault SDK makes it to the cloud
[can be found here](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud). In short, the
Memfault SDK packetizes data into "chunks" that must be pushed to the Memfault
cloud via the
[chunk REST endpoint](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?version=latest#66b0e390-2c3e-4c0d-b6c2-836a287b9e5f).

The Memfault SDK exposes an API that packetizes Memfault data into "chunks".
These "chunks" need to be forwarded to the Memfault Cloud (either directly via
HTTPs or indirectly via a gateway device such as a computer or mobile
application)

:::tip

If you cannot post data directly using HTTP, no problem at all. In fact, that is
one of the most common configurations. In these setups, data can be proxied from
the MCU to a device which can perform a HTTP request over transports such as
UART, BLE, COAP, LoRa, Zigbee, etc). The size of a "chunk" is fully configurable
by you can be tuned to best match your transport requirements. All message
re-assembly is dealt with by Memfault in the cloud.

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"

bool try_send_memfault_data(void) {
  // buffer to copy chunk data into
  uint8_t buf[USER_CHUNK_SIZE];
  size_t buf_len = sizeof(buf);

  bool data_available = memfault_packetizer_get_chunk(buf, &buf_len);
  if (!data_available ) {
    return false; // no more data to send
  }

  // send payload collected to chunks endpoint
  user_transport_send_chunk_data(buf, buf_len);
  return true;
}

void send_memfault_data(void) {
  if (!memfault_packetizer_data_available()) {
    return false; // no new data to send
  }

  // [... user specific logic deciding when & how much data to send
  while (try_send_memfault_data()) { }
}
```
